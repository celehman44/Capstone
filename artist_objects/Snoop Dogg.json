out in the street\nHold ya own was the code that I growed to view\nSo I fucked with and stuck with a chosen few\nBut Snoop Dogg, you can call me, whatever the case\nAnd homie that ain't nothing that the set could erase\nYou put me with the homie, Goldie, though we never had spoke\nA Insane with a 20, now we hell of a close\nAnd y'all kids, my kids, so we family now\nCause I could never see you doing bad without\nAnd that's real\n[Kokane]\nLife is much mo' precious\nThan you'll think\nLike a game'll make yo chips sink\nIt's so hard\nHard to trust a smile and face\nWhen niggas got intentions already taking yo place\nKeep my head up and stand tall\nIf I stumble, then I'll fall\nWill you pick me up at all?\nWill you pick me up at all?\nI'm a keep it gangsta till my end\nCause some people do

earn a little money to drop a dope track\nBack in the days I drove a raggedy Dodge\nCouldn't afford a studio, so we used a garage\nAladdin used to grab a gang of disco breaks\nOne turntable and a broken 808\nMy little brother Tunes and Frank, they hung around all night\nTo make sure that the demo was tight\nDidn't have an enigneer, if you know what I mean\nAladdin did it all at the age of 16\nGifted, uplifted, straight gangsta Mack\nSuckers had me playin' the back\n\nBut thanks to Ice-T I got my foot in the door\nNow I'ma rock the mutha-(uh) till it ain't no more\nWe paid dues\n\nI knew a brother who used to dress just like a faggot\nReal tight jeans, some boots and leather jackets\nHomie as hell, he never came outside\n'Cause everytime I came around, he used to run and hide\nSpoiled like a brat, had everything he wanted\nAnd when he walked, he switched like a woman\nRode a pink bike, man, the sucker was soft\nHad to be in before the street lights came on\nYo, just the other day I turned my radio on\nThe Mack Attack kicked on a brand new song\nI didn't know what it was, I never heard it before\nBut the record was smooth and hardcore\nI said to myself, \"Hey yo, I gotta see this group.\"\nSo I called up Aladdin and the rest of the crew\nGrabbed the nine wit' the hollow point tip\nStepped in the party with a gangster limp\nTook a look at the stage, and yo, whaddya know?\nThe same old faggot from a long time ago\nFrom real tight jeans and the go-go boots\nHe went to Pendeltons and a khaki suit\nNow tell me, ain't this a blip?\nSomebody need to slap the perpetrator in the lip\nYesterday he was a mamma's boy, now he's rappin?\nFoolin' the crowd because he got you all clappin'\nAnd tappin', an example of what I'm tryin' to prove\nA sucker like this who ain't never paid dues\nSo to those who wanna rap, I'm pertainin' to you\nBefore you pick up a mic, you gotta pay dues, word\n\nLet the story be told\nThat's the way it is\nYou got to pay yo'

brothers, they used to boast and brag:\n\"We've got Fubu, and you've got rags!\"\nAnd even worse than that, to make me feel low\nThey gave me a skateboard, while they had low-lows\nGirls used to say, \"Snoop, you're so cute\nBut you gets no rap with that to' up khaki suit\"\nWelllll, one day, up the Avenue\nThere was a man, surrounded by the Dogg Pound crew\nHe said ah, \"Hear ye!
