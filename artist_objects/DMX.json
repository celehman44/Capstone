type of shit (shit)\nOn the remix tip (tip, tip)\nDr. Seuss (Seuss Seuss Suess)\n\nThe Born Loser, not because I choose to be\nBut because all the bad shit happens to me\nI got kids, but their mothers don't want them to know me\nSisters use to like me, but now they call me homie\nUse to have a family now I'm out on my own\nHad to scrap with the Pitt, cause I tried to take his bone\nBitches don't like me, they don't kiss me or hug me\nThey call me Kill-pretty, because I'm mad ugly\nI use to get pussy, but I busted off quick\nNow I gets none, so I gotta beat my dick\nTime are hard in the ghetto, I steal for a living\nEatin turkey flavored Now or Laters for thanksgiving\nIf that ain't enough, life is rough, I swear\nI don't have an address so I can't get welfare\nThey kicked me out the shelter\nBecause they said I smelled a little like the living dead\nAnd look like helter skelter\nMy clothes are so funky, they bad for my health\nSometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by their self\nEven when I was little nothin went my way\nI got beat up, and chased home from school every day\nAnd despite the fact I won all the spelling bees\nOn my report card, I didn't get F's, I got C's\nBut for those who choose to snooze\nSince I was born with no hope, I ain't got nothin to lose...\n\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for

of Liberty, but they really didn't hafta\nLeave my black ass there till the day after\nNo time for laughter, this shit's for real\nRibs are showin through my back, cause I haven't had a meal\nIn about a week, you can see bones in my hands\nThe racoons, beat me to the garbage cans\nI'm Starvin Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that\nThe only thing that I'm carvin, is an alley cat\nBut sometimes in the daytime\nI daydream of a Manwich\nWhen all I'm really eatin is an oxygen sandwich\nFor those that don't know\nThats 2 peices of bread slapped together\nOr I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather\nBorn loser, caught up in the game\nAnd I ain't even got nobody to blame..\n\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\n\nThe Born Loser, yeah, that use to be my m o\nWhen I couldn't get a soul, to listen to my demo\nDoors shut in my face, until I started jammin 'em\nI'm behind the doors now, but I'm the one slammin 'em\nI did what I had to, to get where I got\nThough I'll admit, what I had to do was a lot\nI still gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot\nCatchin vicks just to get a little loot\nI thought it was cute, and didn't care who knew\nMess around get in my way and I'd bag you too\nCause I was, born to lose, straight from the beginning\nHit the dugout, because I struck out the 1st inning\nWinning, was everything, thats why I had to ask\nMy man to front me the loot, and he said I'd be glad to\nNow, who needs a major label, we got our own\nI'm the divine master of the unknown\nAin't nothin changed, I'm the same as before\nWhen opportunity knocks, I'd just answer the door\nBut criminal at heart, even though I don't show it\nI was always a winner I just didn't know it (know it)\n\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\nYoung man went out and made a name for himself\n\nBorn Loser\nDMX the great",

In contrast, carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly dissolved in plasma as bicarbonate ion\nVertebrate blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated\nSome animals, such as crustaceans and mollusks, use hemocyanin to carry oxygen\nInstead of hemoglobin\nInsects and some mollusks use a fluid called hemolymph instead of blood\nThe difference being that hemolymph is not contained in a closed circulatory system\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Two: DMX]\nIn most insects, this \"blood\" does not contain oxygen-carrying\nMolecules such as hemoglobin because their bodies\nAre small enough for their tracheal system to suffice for supplying oxygen\nJawed vertebrates have an adaptive immune system\nBased largely on white blood cells\nWhite blood cells help to resist infections and parasites\nPlatelets are important in the clotting of blood\nArthropods, using hemolymph, have hemocytes as part of their immune system\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Three: DMX]\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels\nBy the pumping action of the heart\nIn animals with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen\nFrom inhaled air to the tissues of the body\nAnd venous blood carries carbon dioxide\nA waste product of metabolism produced by cells\nFrom the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled\nMedical terms related to blood often begin with hemo- or hemato-\n(also spelled haemo- and haemato-) from the Greek word \u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1 (haima)\nFor \"blood\". In terms of anatomy and histology\nBlood is considered a specialized form of connective tissue\nGiven its origin in the bones\nAnd the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of fibrinogen\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse Four: Swizz Beatz]\nDue to its importance to life\nBlood is associated with a large number of beliefs\nOne of the most basic is the use of blood as a symbol\nFor family relationships through birth/parentage\nTo be \"related by blood\" is to be related by ancestry or descendance\nRather than marriage\nThis bears closely to bloodlines\nAnd sayings such as \"blood is thicker than water\"\nAnd \"bad blood\", as well as \"Blood brother\"\nBlood is given particular emphasis in the Jewish and Christian religions\nBecause Leviticus 17:11 says \"the life of a creature is in the blood.\"\nThis phrase is part of the Levitical law forbidding the drinking of blood\nOr eating meat with the blood still intact instead of being poured off\nMythic references to blood can sometimes\nBe connected to the life-giving nature of blood\nSeen in such events as childbirth, as contrasted with the blood of injury or death\nIhave often noticed that\nAncestors never boast\nThe descendants who boast\nOf ancestors\nI would rather start a family than one blood will tell but often it tells too much\nDance mehitabel dance\nCaper and shake a leg\nWhat little blood is left\nWill fizz like wine in a keg\nBlood is a specialized bodily fluid that delivers necessary substances to the body's cells (in animals) \u2013 such as nutrients and oxygen\nAnd transports waste products away from those same cells\n\n[Chorus]", "year": "1999-03-13"}, {"artist": "DMX", "album": "Year of the Dog...

me to lie, 'til I die\nLord, why is it that I go through so much pain?\nAll I saw was black, all I felt was rain\nI come to you because it's you who knows\nYou showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed\nYou gave me the light and let me bask in your glory\nSo it was only right that when you ask for this story\nI put it together to do our dogs some good\nOur dogs bein' brothers and sisters in the hood\nPlenty of times you sent help my way, but I hid\nAnd I remember once you held me close, but I slid\nThere was somethin' that I just had to see\nThat you wanted me to see so I can be what you wanted me to be\nAnd I think I've seen it, 'cause I don't feel the same\nMatter of fact, I know I've seen it, I can feel the change\nAnd it's strange, almost got me beatin' down your door\nBut I've never known a love like this before\nIt's a wonderful feelin' to get away from the pain\nAnd up under the ceilin' I get away from the rain\nAnd the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone\nI know real, so I wipe away the tears; it's on\nAnd I almost lost faith when you took my man\nMonty, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan\nAnd I fear that what I'm sayin' won't be heard until I'm gone\nBut it's all good, 'cause I really didn't expect to live long\nSo if it takes for me to suffer, for my brother to see the light\nGive me pain 'til I die, but please, Lord, treat him right",

to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son\nI gots to do the right thing for shorty\nAnd that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s\nSo I get back lookin' type slick again\nFake niggas jump back on my dick again\nNothin' but love for those that know how it feel\nAnd much respect to all my niggas that kept it real\nKept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong\nNiggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song\nAnd to my boo who stuck with a nigga through\nAll the bullshit, you'll get yours because it's due\n\n[Chorus]\nAyo I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up\nAyo I'm
