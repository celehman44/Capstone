collabin' killin' wack ass crap\nBut then in a blink I wake up and pack that strap\nIn the club cause some other niggas want my head\nI don't know too much about 'em but they won't buy red\nI ain't trippin' don't wanna let the killers in blue start me\nWake up again I'm a DJ Clue party\nWith Diddy and Jim Jones, Juele and Rick Ross\nCat Fay, Trey Songz and Drake this is boss\nAmazing, life's

and I screw\nScat then back to the lab I got some rappin' to do\nThen I wake up again I'm on stage at Paid Dues\nThis characteristic is made to slay crews\nSome tryin' to get at me to battle but they

y'all know I'm breakin' down\nY'all know in my circle the devil's steady makin' rounds\nY'all know I'm missin' my children because I'm shakin' towns\nAnd y'all love my music and how sad I could make it sound\nI'm in the darkness so low I'm under the carpet\nWhoever wants me to park it you motherfuckers is heartless\nThey want me stuck with hardships, want a unhappy artist\nBut I'ma break apart from this KOD shit regardless\nOf who's mad, a lot of my shit is too sad\nLike the death of Micheal Jackson, motherfucker who's bad?\nTo jump right up out of myself, this shit's a fight on my health\nThe darkness is sellin' but I really wanna put y'all some light on the shelf\nWill you still be able to feel me\nEven if I'm not talkin' about tryin' to kill me\nThe King of Darkness can no

who love it never really had to live it\nNow they mad and livid, I don't want no sad to visit\nMy music thinkin' I'm about to lose it so they bash and diss it\nBefore they even hear what I have comin' this year\nI'ma be that lit spear let's get some of this shit clear\nI ain't switchin' to mainstream only what is happenin' is\nYou watchin' the mainstream go me\nSo watch me bloom out of this

today, damn\nI'm in a crossroad, I'm tryin' to go into the light\nLike Carol Ann there I stand still a lost soul\nOn the subject on when I talk low\nI'm ready to dangle this darkness\nAt the top of the catacombs and toss those\nBut will you still be with me or just kill me quickly\nAway with the darkness but I promise the flow will still be sickly\nI am the king and I always have the throne\nBut

some people hide it\nBut other people they do it whenever they get excited\nBut me I can't even do it when the wrongs all mine\nI'm saying I've been trying to do it for a long long time\nI get jealous when I see people do it and it's like fluid\nI'm thinking how can they swallow that when I can't even chew it\nI guess God seen it fit to label me the consoler\nBestowed upon a broken show and forever be the shoulder\nMy mission is plain to see, it's freaking insanity\nI'm wishing the pain in me would just leave me be why can't it be\nSimple 'cause on the real this one could die\nSo I'm asking God Before I go just give me one good cry\n\n[Hook]\nIf I could cry maybe one good time\nI could wash away all my pain and maybe free my mind\nAfter my shows it's a lonely road\nSo I sit up all by myself

I sneeze I tear up, and then I go look in a mirror\nSo I can see how it looks, when I really wanna know how it feels\nWhen I'm hella down I try to push, no matter how hard no water spills for real\nMy patience is soon to go, waiting for the balloon to blow\nI'm thinking back to when I used to go to funerals\nNo matter how close we were, on the inside it ached while\nOthers be losing it, I'm wishing I could just break down\nAnd I been to a lot of them, and there's not a one\nThat went on and got it done, no moisture that even try even to come\nAnd this ain't no tough thing, 'cause I've had enough pain\nTears should be runnin' like Mustang's, man it must rain\nBeen trying for years, but the crying been inside\nAnd the Nina so serious, there ain't no lying in his eyes\nAnd it makes me so furious, when I look and I'm in genocide\nPlease let me break down with the pain I felt when Brian Dennis died\nOne time..\n\n[Hook]\nIf I could cry maybe one good time I could wash away all my

anyway\n\n[Verse 3]\nI look at actors crying, it's as easy as fondue\nBut what do you do when extreme hurt is upon you\nReal life ain't no movie homie, and this ain't John Woo\nBut I almost lost it at the ending of John Q\nAnd I almost lost it when Jennifer Hudson blew\nBut I'm still waiting for that real emotion to come through\nThen maybe I could get a cry God\nMaybe one, two?\nBeen red for life for the first time ever me want blue\n(What?)\nGive me the blues, sometimes I turn on the news\nAnd I look at all these feuds, then I try to make them ooze\n(Don't cry, no teardrops from your eye\nPoetry's music oh my, almost made me tear up about thinking about my children, no lie)\nMaybe I'm black hearted, you thinking damn he shady\nOr saying man he crazy, for the way I abandon me lady\nOne day she can repay me, yes that woman can betray me\nThen I'll probably cry if not than I do it if I win me a Grammy maybe\n\n[Hook]\nIf I could cry maybe one good time\nI could wash away all my pain, and maybe free my mind\nAfter my shows, it's a lonely road\nSo I sit up all by myself trying to cleanse my soul\nNobody's looking at me anyway\nJust give me one good time, hey, hey\nNobody's

cannibal over serpent rattles\nI'm seeing shadows and bodies swingin' from gallows\nAs I'm sitting in a circle surrounded by seven candles\nMy eyes rolls back, I speak in tongues, I bleed from gums\nIt's time to hit the streets with guns\nI'm bustin' seventy shots laughin' as the people run\nI plead to be free from these evil deeds I've done\nUntil the pain coincides with my violence and agony\nOh the humanity, why does he keep stabbing me\nBut it's me that I'm stabbing, it's self-inflicted wounds\nThe Hitchcock of hip-hop, the end is comin' soon\n\n[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]\nYou don't
