I don't give a damn if you're black, white, or any color in between. I don't care if you're Christian, you're Muslim, you're gay, you're straight. I'm here to fight for your equality. Because I believe that we are all born equal, but we are not treated equally and that is why we must fight. We must fight for the equality of every man, woman and child, regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation. So, I say here and now, if you believe in this message and my lessons of peace, love, and positivity, and equality for all, then I demand that you rise to your feet and applaud not only for yourselves, but for the foundation we are laying for our children", "year": "2017-09-01"}, {"artist": "Logic", "album": null, "title": "1-800-273-8255 T\u00fcrk\u00e7e \u00c7eviri", "lyrics":

they buy the brand\nThere's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit\nFelt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit\nThank God, he never let Lucifer close

And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else\u2019s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not bout the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about.

to be loved\nBy parents that was in too deep with the drugs\nNigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit\nBe who you are, identify as a star\nNo one tells you you're that\nIt's something that you just know\nThe world be stealing your glow\nYour mama did what she could\nHer life was miles from good\nYour father fell in the trap\nThey set for you when you black\nThey met when they was low\nAnd therefore you a product of that\nAnd so your trauma is deep\nDon't bury it you should weep\nAnd clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em\nJust my opinion, only then can you find peace\nJust start to notice happiness don't come from album release\nI've been through it before\nCan only share with you what I know\nTo be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you\nAnd you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try\nThis is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly\nThe truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky\nBut if you want to then you ought to know why\nAre you running from something\nWith hopes of becoming someone\nThat's finally worthy of love\nLet me tell you now, you're worthy enough\nFuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous

the heart of Hollywood\nI stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars\nWhen suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic\nAs my body began to fade\nIn this moment my mind was full of clarity\nBut my body insisted it was in danger\nI looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine\nBut I was convinced that something was wrong\nBefore I knew it I felt as though I was going to\nFall and fade away\nMy body grew weak\nAnd soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety\nI refused to believe this story\nI searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me\nI began to feel detached from reality\nI felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass\nI got blood work done\nAnalysis of my mind and body to no avail\nThe doctor said it was anxiety\nBut how could it be anxiety?\nHow could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?\nHow could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?\nDerealization\nThe sense of being out of one\u2019s body\nI\u2019m not here\nI\u2019m not me\nI\u2019m not real\nNothing is\nNothing but this feeling of panic\nNobody understands\nNobody knows the sufferings\nThis physical feeling\nIt can\u2019t be anxiety\nIt can\u2019t\nOr can it?\nCan it in fact be the mind controlling the body?\nYeah, of course\nI\u2019m so in control of my mind and my body\nBut I\u2019m subconsciously forcing myself into a state\nOf self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind\nI am unhappy\nNot with life\nBut with this feeling\nI am scared, I am human, I am a man\nBut I look in the mirror and I see a child\nI am an adult who recognize grown ups don\u2019t really know shit\nAnd they never did\nAnd it scares me\nCause now I\u2019m just a grown up who doesn\u2019t know shit\nBut one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me\nNo, no this feeling\nThis anxiety is nothing\nI have anxiety\nJust like you, the person I wrote this for\nAnd together we will overcome this feeling\nWe will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge\nThat we are alive\nAnd any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted\nWe will rejoice in this gift that is life\nWe will rejoice in this day that we have been given\nWe will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves\nStarting with mental health\nWe will accept ourselves as we are\nAnd we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror\nWe will accept ourselves\nAnd live with anxiety", "year": "2017-05-05"}, {"artist": "Logic", "album": "Young Sinatra", "title": "Are You Ready", "lyrics": "[Hook]\nEverybody like (Hey!) are you ready to go?

Atom but like the \"first man\" right? But spelled A-T-O-M, like the atoms in our body and everything connecting us. He gets hit by a car and wakes up in a white void. And he's talking to this random guy. And the guy's like \"Life, What's it all about?\" And he's like \"What? What the fuck you talkin' about?\" He's like \"Where am I?\" Well, it turns out the random guy is actually God. Have you ever heard of this guy named Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Scientist, scientist, astrophysicist, crazy, super awesome, and I don't know how the hell I did it, but I got him to play the role of God on my album. Which is crazy\n\n[Logic On His Couch]\nI can't even believe that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is on this album. Like when I think about it, that's like the most gangster feature of all time\n\n[Logic and Neil Recording]\nLogic: So what now, what advice can you give me?\nNeil: What advice can I give humanity?\n\n[Logic And Friends In The Studio]\nYou guys know Big Von? He's like the radio DJ from the bay, on KMEL\n\n[Steve Wyreman]\nOh Yeah\n\n[Logic]\nSo he plays this guy named Atom\n\n[Big Von and Logic Recording]\nBig Von: Wait, wait, wait, what? Stop all the hippie shit\n\n[Logic Explaining Concept]\nThis guy Atom dies and it's a whole conversation between them. And he finds out that he is about to be reincarnated. And then he finds out that not only that is he being reincarnated, but that he is everybody who has ever been reincarnated because there is only one human being. And he has been reincarnated so many times, in fact, that he is every human being that has ever existed. You know he was Jesus and all of his disciples. He was Hitler and everybody that he murdered. You know, every time he extended a hand of kindness to someone, he was doing it to himself. Every time he was extending a hand of hatred or murder to someone, he was only doing it onto himself. And it isn't until he has lived in the shoes of ever man, woman, child, race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation that he will know what it is to appreciate life and then be taken to the next plane of existence. So every time I'm rapping on the album pretty much, I'm rapping from the perspectives of one of the lives he has lived. So it's very sci-fi, but it's very real at the same time. It's weird man, it's a good one\n\n[No I.D.]\nHip-Hop artists are tasked to not have any imagination, but to actually work in direct correlation to where they are from, who they were, and you know he has a lot of imagination\n\n[Logic In His House]\nI was actually really inspired when I read a short story that was written by a writer by the name of Andy Weir called \"The Egg.\" I read it and it inspired me so much, and it's essentially the same thing, it's just my take on it. You know, it's a man who dies and is reincarnated and lives every life ever. And I thought \"wow,\" I relate to more than just one sect or one side of humanity or race being biracial. I kind of feel that. I feel kind of what what it's like to be two people. To be like a black man in a fair skinned body, if that makes any sense. So it's like wow, it's almost like living two separate lives to the public. Not to me, but to others.  They might view me as different people. I guess wow, that's crazy I never really thought of it like that\n\n[No I.D.]\nSo bringing who he is into the stories that he wants to tell and having them intertwine with reality and fantasy, sci-fi, That's the difficult thing to score\n\n[Logic]\nI didn't think I was going to be able to pull it off. I mean how do you pull off that? How do you pull off an album rapping from different perspectives of a life that one man lived, who is actually everyone ever. it's just crazy, but I don't know how the hell it came together, but it did\n\n[Hallelujah Interlude]\n\n[Logic Outside His House]\nThis is so much more than just music. It's like a true personal part of my life. So, I'm getting my license, I'm doing my best to get fit and in shape, and deal with being mentally healthy and physically healthy. And dealing with my music and friends, wife, personal relationship, and dogs and everything. So I just want you guys to see as much of my life as you can see\n\n[Logic Driving]\nSo yesterday, I think i was telling Mike that I had the wildest anxiety ever. In my mind I was like, I'm like \"I'm fine, I'm fine\" I don't know why but I was feeling physically weird. Not like ill or anything, just like- faint. You know kind of dizzy, kind of out of it. Very disconnected\n\n[Fan Recognizes Logic]\nFan: Logic?\nLogic: 'Sup dude?\nFan: What's going on man, how's you day?\nLogic: Nice, I got an appointment. What's your name man?\nFan: Raymond\nLogic: *Shakes his hand* Nice to meet you Raymond\nRaymond: You have a great day\nLogic: Thanks brother\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, that's a big thing that I've been dealing with so much, which is like anxiety. A lot of people don't understand it and that's why I'm like having you document this right now because I want to invite everybody into my life like never before and I have severe anxiety and it's hard and it sucks\n\n[Logic Making Beats]\n\n[Logic]\nIt's just so crazy because I've always-like I'm on my shit you know what I mean? Like I'm on my shit and I know what I need to do and how I need to do things But then anxiety can step in and be like \"you feel up to having this meeting or this conversation or going on stage or performing or this or that, But I'm gonna fuck you up.\" Like it's weird, it's crazy and so anxiety is so much more than just mental. it's a mental thing that can affect you physically and that's why when I had the biggest panic attack I ever had last year, you know just after The Incredible True Story was made, I was convinced I was going through was a physical thing. I was convinced it was something deeper like it was fucking cancer. Like, you know what I mean? Cause my body was so fucked up and um, it's not that. It's my mind. It's anxiety\n\n[Making of Anziety]\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nWhen I went in the booth and I knew all of you guys were all out there listening, and I was learning it there and then on the spot, what he wanted me to sing. Damn, my legs were shaking, I was so nervous, It was the first time I sung it and I guess that\u2019s when you really-like I realized that he's got a vision and I have to trust it because I wanted to practice it and get better at it, he comes back in and I was like I wanna know, I want to capture how you are right now when you're singing this for the first time\n\n[Logic]\nI think that's good, ah!\n\n[Rose]\nThe first time in my life I have done anything like that\n\n[Logic]\nYou never?\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nI'm not really sure how it goes\n\n[Lucy Rose Back Outside]\nNow listening back i really understand why he wanted to do that cause there was a vulnerability to what was captured that i don't know if that would have been the same if I had learnt it\n\n[Logic and Lucy In The Booth]\n\n[Logic Recording \"Anziety\"]\n\n[Logic]\nYo, making music makes me feel good man. Like when I'm here with you guys, like not to sound any type of way, a lot of that,I mean I still be feelin' weird, but a lot of it goes away. It's like I have purpose with you guys\n\n[Logic Four Days Later]\nHold on, I'm trying to think... one sec'. Should it end with the hook? Or maybe-maybe that's not the hook. Maybe I keep going right now and then I bring the hook again... that's what I'll do, I will extend this verse...\n\n[Records Rest Of \"Anziety\"]\n\nIt's always really hard to recreate a vibe, because I was in such a zone the other night. I have to tap back into that same energy. It's gotta be the same\n\n[Records More Of \"Anziety\"]\n\nAlright, NO NO. Can you pause it? I fucking hate technology. Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it... alright can you run it back with the last shit i was doing? My fucking- my phone deleted all the shit. Fucking hate this shit\n\nI think this is harder than when I did \"Gang Related.\"\n\n[Continues]\n\nLet me hear that... Woo!\n\n[Logic to Bart Simpson figure]\nSo I need you to bring it back so it sounds really good, you know? You gotta make it like, you gotta make my vocals pop, period. Like I'm going here and this breaks, like you gotta feel it in your soul. As the Engineer you need to know what you're doing. [Anziety bass boosted] You know what I'm saying? Gotta be really good\n\n[Bobby Campbell]\nI lost my job to Bart Simpson?\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, you're fucking out bro\n\n(Driving)\nI was with No I.D. yesterday, Haden't seen him for a while. And we just had a real good talk. Man to man, shot some pool\n\n[No I.D]\nWe shoot pool, and I just want it know I won 3 games today. (Camera man: he's gonna edit that out) it doesn't matter... WHEN YOU EDIT THIS JUST KNOW... 3-0\n\n[Logic]\nJust out of nowhere, then I played him my album. And he loved it\n\n[No I.D.]\nMy thoughts were just by far his best work, for me\n\n[Logic]\nAnd I asked him to rap on it, and he said yeah\n\n[No I.D.]\nI mean, I can- I can rap\n\n[Logic]\nNo I.D. is going to rap on my album. Which is like, what, that's so unheard of\n\n[No I.D.]\nI haven't really recorded a song in 20 years\n\n[Logic]\nI texted J.Cole and I was like \"Yo, Deon's rapping on my album, No I.D.\", and he was like \"WHAT, how the fuck did you get him to do that?\" and I thought about it, and I just asked him. \"Only you could get him to do that\"\n\nI've waited for this moment my whole life. Right now, nothing else matters. Just making music here with Deon\n\n[Making of America]\nThe concept is how we're all and what's going on in the Native American community that's being ignored\n\n[America Interlude]\n\n[Logic]\nAmerica, so America came together, you all were there. That shit was crazy. I just found these like sample packs or like little things and like vocals and I was pressing them, and I was throwing drums on, and creating the pads\n\n[Production of America beat]\n\nWhen I create music I hear sounds. Distinct-- That's why you can hear my shit when you got to festivals or whatever. They sing all the words because it's catchy. All the sounds are catchy. First things you hear, Woo... that's the \"ohhhh \" and it goes off\n\nYou'll hear a switch up and then I'm just rapping from like a hood motherfucker and that's all he knows. And like, that's a lot of my own experience like with my brothers, and then my boy Lenny is like helping me voice this, you'll hear it\n\n[Big Lenbo in the booth]\n\n[Lenny]\nWhen Logic approached me with the contributing to the song \"America\" he laid it out. He knew what he wanted so he gave me the inspiration. Told me exactly what he was going for in that part of the song\n\n[No I.D.]\nWe worked on the first album, and I was the Executive Producer. And some of the first session into the album I pretty much knew he was a producer, not just a rapper. I told him \"hey, you don't really need me to produce your records, because you have your ideas. You need to you know have access to the personnel and techniques to deliver your thoughts.\"\n\n[Bobby Campbell]\nThe first album was 6ix and Logic, the exact same way they did it on the mixtapes. Like nothing has changed from that you know. These two guys, sitting in the house, not the big studio, not even down here, not anywhere special. Just the two of them sitting down with the laptop, a concept, and some kind of inspiration\n\n[6ix]\nWhat's crazy too is you know, the same process we were doing back in the day. Like , we didn't have the string players, we didn't have the vocalists with us. That's what's so crazy about it is, the process is the same, but now we get to involve actual real musicians, rather than me tryna sample a string part from another song because I can't play it. But now I can be like, we have Claire and Tom to actually play the shit\n\n[Lenbo]\nBig Von, he just gets really entertaining\n\n[Big Von recording skits]\n\n[Big Von]\nGot Neil on the album, you know how crazy that is? Space, Time, all the good things like that.  Man, Logic has come up with the crazy story of all stories\n\n[Logic to Damian Lemar Hudson]\nSo I was in Paris, with my wife, at the Louvre\n\n[Sam Spratt]\nSo, it all started last summer when I get a call from Bob. And I pick up the phone, and It's three in the morning, and I say \"Bob, what's up man, what the fuck is this?\" And he's like \"I'm in Paris man, I'm at the Louvre, and I know what our album is going to be.\"\n\n[Logic]\nEverybody is looking at the Mona Lisa, and I'm looking at the Mona Lisa like \"Wow, Leonardo Da Vinci painted this shit. Woah, this is crazy.\"\nBut then I'm looking at, myself included, everyone is so focused on the Mona Lisa, I'm in this insane museum with all this beautiful statues and paintings and all different types of stuff. So I was like \"I'm gonna go look for something else\", not just focus on this. And I turn around, and as soon as I turn around I see this\n\nThis is The Wedding at Cana. It was when Jesus turned water into wine\n\n[Sam Spratt]\nI'm like \"Dude, doesn't that have like a hundred people in it?\" and he's like \"Yeah, it has like over 100 people. I don't know if we need that many, but like close. I want you to paint all of it. I want all my friends, all my family, everyone who works on this albums, people of all races, colors, creeds, sexual orientations, and genders. I wasn't it to be representative of Everybody.\"\n\nEarly into the year I decided I wanted to go to Italy to get inspiration for this. I did my research online, went through google image search, and I studied countless books about the artist himself, other artists in the period, but theres limits to that. there was something about it where I felt compelled-- I always wanted to go to Italy. if there was ever a chance, why not now?\n\nI went to every possible church I could, I went to the museum, I saw the Caravaggio, I immersed myself in everything I've loved and researched and I brought it back and put everything into the cover\n\n[Logic]\nThis is going to be my album cover\n\n[Sam Spratt]\nThe album is told from a variety of perspectives, which is something Bob loves to do. Putting himself in someone else's shoes and taking on their struggles and success, trying to see things through their perspective. This album, listening to it, sonically connects you to the art. it just executes that flawlessly\n\n[Logic] For the longest time, I just wanted to focus on the music and not talk about race or negative shit going on in the world because I wanted it to be happy and fun, and about lyricism and raw shit. I felt that i needed to make and album like this because me being black & white and feeling discriminated against by my own people, made me feel like I need to talk about everyone else who was discriminated against\n\nI didn't wanna be like \"I'm biracial, but I look white and blah blah blah, no I'm really gonna talk about not only what's on my heart and mind, but whats on the hearts and minds of people all over the world who don't have the voice that I do\n\nI am here with Patrick Starr in my studio. And I recruited him because he's amazing and awesome and he's a very sweet, kind person, and an amazing business man-- Or business queen. No, but honestly, he's just been so awesome and he's just such a great role model for so many people I wanted to include him as a representative for his culture and just have him on the album and album cover\n\n[Starr]\nThank you! This is dope, so dope\n\n[Logic]\nI appreciate it, Thank you\n\n[Patrick Starr in the booth]\n\n[Logic]\nI see good people who like to make good music and it's just that simple. Like \"Hey, do you like what I'm doing? Do you like what I stand for? Oh you like this message? you wanna come play? You wanna be a part of it? Yes or No?\"\n\nSo I'm flying this woman out, from the Bahamas, where me and my wife went on our anniversary. Her name is Paula\n\n[Paula McKeva]\nHiii, I'm Paula McKeva, all the was from [?], Bahamas. Met Bobby, known as Logic as well, in the Atlantis resort and Casino Hotel\n\n[Logic]\nWe were at the bar having a few drinks and this shit was killing it\n\n[McKeva]\nI was singing Uptown Funk, so everyone was on the floor having fun\n\n[Logic]\nI was like up, and I was dancing with like all these older ladies and shit. It was like so fun\n\nBut like she KILLED it. her voice was like killing it. She was doing like Whitney Houston songs and shit\n\n[McKeva]\nI told him to come on the stage and said \"Show me what you got.\" Then he went WILD and crazy. I didn't know who he was\n\n[Logic]\nAfter dinner, and she went to take a little break, I asked her if she wanted to come sing on my album, and she said \"yeah.\"\n\n[McKeva in the booth]\n\n[Kev Randolph playing around on the keys]\n\n[Bobby Campbell]\nKev, i love what you're doing, but we're gonna mute that sound\n\n[Killing Spree Interlude]\n\n[Booth Harmonizing]\n\n[Confess plays]\n\n[Logic crying]\nI just had this crazy cry because I'm happy though. And I'm not trying to milk anything, but I thought I should let you know. I just wanted to in this moment-- Let you know I was listening to this song, \"Anziety\" and just thinking about how hard it is to live with it. But beyond that, the song, it made me realize how many people are here. How many people are in this house. And how blessed I am to have my wife and my dogs  and my friends and music and fans. I can't believe it. Because I didn't have anything growing up, I didn't have anything. And now I have everything I could have ever wanted. And just right now in this moment I am so happy and blessed. Sorry, I just wanted to real quick-- I'm not trying to milk it or anything. I just wanted to say that, that i can't believe it's all real and happening\n\n[1-800-273-8255 producing]\n\n[Khalid in the booth]\n\n[Logic] We're at Warner Bros. We are at the soundstage where they do all the scoring for films, and we are doing the album. And I'm excited, I feel like I don't belong here\n\n(to the orchestra)\nI just wanted to say this is fucking crazy. Like, I'm sorry, this is just crazy and I know we're here to work but like I came from nothing-- so to be able to be here today is a very emotional thing. And this album is about the equality of man regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation. This is the fight for equality\n\n[Orchestra plays]\n\n[6ix]\nYo, Bob, you know what's really crazy? Making a beat on Ableton of FLstudio and then like seeing that shit charted out and noted. That's amazing, isn't that like crazy\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, we're just like Neanderthals\n\n(Laughing)\n\n[6ix]\nLike all the sheet music, but like what we sample\n\n[Orchestra plays]\n\n[Bobby Hall(Logic's dad)]\nMy name is Bobby \"Smokey\" Hall, I'm legend. I'm the legend of hip-hop go-go. I'm here to see my son, Logic, one of the hypest artists out there. He's just in his own zone. He's got a string session going on right now. [?] so yeah, I love him\n\n[logic conducts the orchestra]\n\n[Logic]\nIt's been an amazing experience, and I really appreciate it (Crying)\n\n[Bobby Hall]\nBobby has always been driven, even as a kid. He was a leader, not a follower. He never followed, you know what I'm saying? he had his own way that he lived\n\nI took Bobby in the recording studio when he was like 15 for the first time. And he spit for like 45 minutes, non-stop. The engineer and I, Rock, just laughed and said \"That boy got bars.\"\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nYou were talking to your mates last night on the sofa and I was just like listening in and trying to learn what you guys were talking about. And you were saying like \"We work with loads of people, but we FUCK with Logic.\" And I was like... excuse me? You were like \"You know what I'm saying,  we FUCK with Logic. We FUCK with him you know what I'm saying?\" And I'm like what are you talking about? I had no idea what that meant\n\n[Logic]\nSo when did that click for you what that meant?\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nOh, only like 24 hours later, when I asked what it was. Did I ask one of you guys? I was like \"What does that mean when you fuck with someone?\" I thought if you're fucking with someone, you're fucking them up or something\n\n(Laughing)\n\n[Logic]\nThis is a classic documentary moment right here\n\n[Who?]\nLucy i got a better one for you. You ever heard of what a fuckboy is?\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nSo yeah, that, Jess said, before she met you, \"I wen't out with a couple of fuckboys\" and I was like is that just some one like, you have sex with?\n\n(Laughing)\n\nShe said that just means like a lame person\n\nWell, I fuck with Logic\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, we fuck with you Lucy Rose\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nI fuck with you all\n\n[Logic]\nWe fuck with you\n\n(Laughing)\n\n[Logic]\nIt was a long-ass time ago, I'm in the studio with this mo-fucker and he brings this in\nAnd I'm like \"Dillon what's that?\" And he's like \"its that P1 bro, for sure.\"  And I'm like \"damn that's crazy, thats so cool\", he's like \"yeah man check it out\", doing all this shit and I'm like oh my god, I gotta have this\n\nSo i hopped in the whip, I go, I drop the bread on this shit immediately, and all I get out of it , like used it for. I spent all that money, and  got the kick for \"Like Woah\", and it's worth every penny\n\n[Sir Dylan and 6ix working on Ink Blot]\n\n[Logic]\nThis is rapped from the perspective of a rapper that like, the first half, it almost sounds like a sample with the vocals, but it's all myself. And he's saying like \" I don't want to sleep all day and get up at night\" like eh's not happy with  the life that he's living because he's one of those rappers focussing on money and material possessions\n\nIt's called \"Ink Blot\" because one of the line is \"I'm not me, I'm who you want me to be.\" And he's rapping like \"yeah I got this money and I'm not a real rapper it's all bullshit, I'm making my money, fuck it.\"\n\nLike that personification of that rapper like that tone, chain wearing, \"yeah yeah I rap\", but deep down he's not happy, but his raps are like yeah I got this and millions. it's just a rapper who isn't happy with himself, but is making a lot of money. So that's the song\n[Juciy J & Logic recording Ink Blot]\nPerpetratin' ass, dumb ass mothafuckas, man\nAll on the 'Gram, all on the Snapchat with the bullshit\nKill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga\nKill yo' mothafuckin self, nigga\nAnd tell yo' bitch I said slob on my knob\nThat\u2019s crazy!\nYo, I\u2019ma keep all this shit for the album\nOh they gon' love that, they gon' be like, \"Aw fuck\"\n\n[Logic]\nSo, we're here, on Scotch Wednesday, it's a little thing I do with my buddies. Every Wednesday, as grown men, we drink scotch, shoot pool, play some jazz and Sinatra on vinyl over there. (cheers)\n\n[Camera man to Logic]\nDid you smoke a Jefferey?\n\n[Logic (rubbing the wall)]\nFreefalllll\n\n[Logic]\nWoah wait, who has some other really good ones you can impersonate? Like Sinatra... OH give me Tonight Show All hand on deck, go\n\n(All hands on deck)\n\nKeep going\n\n[Jessica]\nYou're gonna do great. (Kiss) ... you just totally left me hanging\n\n[Logic]\nOh, sorry\n\n[Driving instructor]\nHello, sir, how are you doing today?\n\n[Logic]\nI'm doing good, how are you doing?\n\n[Instructor]\nYou brought the whole--\n\n[Logic]\nYeah, we brought the whole team\n\n[Driving Instructor]\nOh, excuse me, who is taking the picture?\n\n[Logic]\nI'm upset that i did what i'm supposed to do. that's the thing I'm telling you man. It's not like a fail. I;ve failed before, many times. it's just that when you know you did everything, you know you did it\n\n[Christian Martin]\nWe're at the DMV. Bob's taking his driving test for the second shot. And uh, I'm a little bit nervous. I know he can drive, but just these instructors take of points for the craziest things\n\n[Logic]\nThank you, 29, I can go in through here. Swag\n\nGot that license though\n\n[Black Spiderman Piano interlude]\n\n[Logic]\n\"Black Spiderman\" I wrote, first and foremost, it's about stereotypes, and that people make me believe I should be ashamed of who I am, and I'm not\n\n[Logic in the booth]\n\n[Logic]\nLike, be you, fuck EVERYBODY else, just be you. And people are goig to hate on you, they hate on me and my message is \"Peace, Love and Positivity\", and people HATE me. Like think about that... That's CRAZY! When you look at people you see things. You see a black man, you see a middle eastern man, you see,... there are people that are conditioned to look at people of color or people that are brown on an airplane a little weird. and that's so FUCKED up and I hate  that. People look at me and I go, \"I'm a rapper\", and they go \"What?\" or people are conditioned to not accept me in hip-hop because of how  i look, or how i speak. \"Oh, you speak white\" or \"you talk white\", like the fuck? I've heard that my whole life I'm saying in general for this career. What do you mean \"talk white\"? What the fuck does that mean?\n\nI said fuck that, why can't Spiderman be black? Why can't James Bon be gay? Why not? like fuck it! And that's why I open it up with \"Black Jesus, Black jesus\". And people are like \"What? Black jesus? What the fuck?\" Like I've got a Black Santa Clause right now in my house\n\n[Booth Session]\n\n[Logic]\nI've known Damian for 6-7 years now, maybe even 8 years. And we've just been buddies like through the internet. And we used to do records together. I wasn't shit, I wasn't nobody. I knew I wanted him to be on the album, and he dropped EVERYTHING to come out here. With no promise of placement or anything like that, just to see where he could contribute. And I'm sitting down there, and we're working, and I'm like \"I think I need some vocals on here\". And, like I said, i trust everybody, who knows what's going to happen? You want to go in there, and let's see what you got. He told me before Bobby hit record, that you could hear it in the microphone, his heart pumping\n\n[Damian Lemar Hudson]\nAnd like, I could just feel the magnitude of this moment. And how pivotal it was\n\n[Logic]\nHe was like \"this is 6 years in the making that just came out\". And...\n\n[Damian]\nI don't know, something just hit me and I started letting loose\n\n[Damian in the booth]\n\n[Damian]\nSomething about that, some type of [?] grabbed me and let me soar vocally\n\n[Logic while listening]\nYES! Praise him! I'm putting this on the album! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW (to Damian). COME HERE!\n\n[Logic]\nYou just earned yourself a feature credit\n\n[Damian]\nIt was like one of those milestones in your career where you know you're just in the right room, and the right mind state. Everything just lined up\n\n[Logic]\nI only work with people that are as good and creative as I am in their field. I like when people make me feel fucking stupid. I like  when people are so good at playing strings, or piano, or singing, or whatever that makes me feel talentless. I can't do what they do. Like I'm Batman. I'm Player 1, I'm Super Mario, so are you guys behind the camera, so is 6ix. I don't work with Player 2s, I don't work with Robins. I work with other Batmen, and I know that sounds really weird, but what i mean by that is you, whenever you leave, and you take this camera to do whatever you do, you are a boss. You're a boss, and you go do boss shit. But when you're with me, you're under my wing, being a boss, helping me paint my boss-ass picture\n\n[C-Sick]\nWith Logic, time to go to the basement. It's my time to shine. Hopefully I have something that actually like fit on the project\n\n[Mos Definitely Interlude]\n\n[C-Sick]\nWhen i first met [?] I could see this [?]\n\n[Logic in the booth]\n\n[Killer Mike]\nI mean, he's a superior lyricist. We already know that. He puts together classic albums, we know that. This is beautiful, it's rich, it's moody, it revs you up and brings you down. It's an ALBUM, and in an age where that may not be important, it's refreshing. You know? so, bravo! I've told him before, I think he's one of the best in the world\n\n[Logic]\nMannnn, come on. Thanks man\n\n[Lucy Rose]\nLogic's music makes me feel something. I don't listen to a whole lot of hip-hop or rap music. And when I first met Bobby he did ask me \" Why do you listen to my music? Like I don't understand\". \"Like you play this sweet folk music and then you listen to my music.\" but there's something about it I just can't explain, but it makes me really feel something\n\n[Logic]\nIt's kind of scary. I can't explain. like when I first started making music I was willing to sacrifice everything because I had nothing to lose. But now, i have everything to lose. That isn't a bad thing. That just means I have a good life\n\nIt makes me work harder. Because I was working so hard to obtain all of this. But now I have to work even harder to keep it\nOoooo I just gave you some fire!\n\nWith my last album I went around to radio stations, and I shook hands, and I jerked people off. And I was like \"Yeah what's up!\" trying to get radio placements. But not like trying to work for the radio, but like trying to get more people to hear. And  this time, I'm like fuck that shit. I'm not going nowhere, i'm not doing any press. This album has already done what it was intended to do, and it was to set me free of any shame the public made me feel. It did what it was intended to do because I don't give a shit what anybody else thinks\n\nAnd I'm really not gonna try to get too much into it, but I had a conversation with J.Cole about the public, and being on social media, and all these things. Like I don't need the public to accept me. I don't need anybody to tell me my music is great, or I'm amazing. Because I know I'm good, I know I'm great, and I know I'm amazing. Just like you, and them, so fuck anybody else and what they got to say because I know I'm good, and that's what this album is about. Knowing that you're beautiful, you're great, and you're special. Knowing that you are something, were something, and will be something\n\nSo fuck everybody else\n\n[Credits]", "year": "2017-05-05"}, {"artist": "Logic", "album": "Leaks of The Industry '14", "title": "Everything I Am", "lyrics": "[Intro - Big Sean]\nIf I want it\nIf I believe I can have it\nThen that's my reality\nI'll attract it\n\n[Hook : Jay-Z]\nEverything I seen made me everything I am\nEverything I do I'm a man behind mine\n(throw your hands in the air) and stand behind mine\nEverything I seen made me everything I am\n(If you're real as me)\nAnd stand behind mine\nEverything I do I'm a man behind mine\n\n[Verse 1 : Logic]\nYeah, yeah, visionary the second coming of Roc-A-Fella\nResurrecting the real like holograms at Coachella\nFrom Maryland where they throwing up signs like Hellen Keller\nCutting records like helicopter propellers that propell us to the sky\nWhile these motherfuckers wondering why we get high\nNever knowin' Imma be flowin' 'till the day I die\nLivin' life followin' my dreams, everything ain't what it seems\nEverything ain't what it seems, when you're climbing to the top\nLabel asking for my album, the single ain't even drop\nBut the fans anticipating greatness can't fuck with fakeness\nRattpack until I D.I.E that's where I'm finna take this\nV's up motherfucker let me get it right now, sorry for my lateness\nI dedicate this to all the people that love to hate us\nNever mistake this I'm getting money but keep it real\nAnd got my eyes on a diamond like I'm a centre field\nMotherfucker how I feel\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2 : Hit-Boy]\nStill at the intro, my \"I'm tryna convince flow\"\nGetting it how I live through rhymes written with pencils\nTime stuck in the interm, dreaming of living better\nI'm Nagina Market, questions like \"how we get this cheddar?\"\nBread and this lettuce, if you don't give it up I'm takin' it\nI'm in love, had a date with fate now I'm facin' it\nFuck niggas away from me, baby mothers waivering\nLittle momma like your son home, just embrace the kid\nCause I'll be here for a minute like I'm going 60 seconds\nEvery time you hear a record and it's great, think of me\nHow many song they got sound same 53\nWho gon' save the game, shit that shouldn't be a mystery\nWe the plug, that's the team, clean the guns, pack the beam\nI the skull *badabing* and they gone\nAll that weak shit exposed get it buried\nSaid a word and I\u2019m releasing the levee\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 : PriceTag & Oktane]\nBoy, I used to practice my autograph in class nigga\nI guess I always knew I would be that nigga\nThey want you to second guess they want you to doubt\nSo we just became the kids that our parents warned us about\nWanted to bounce from the crib soon as I graduated school\nWas there shit else I could learn, I had to make my own rules\nI hit the streets with them young mechanics\nThat was holding them tools\nYou disrespect them son in their hood and get screwed\nNigga now move!, now tell me who wanna fuck with us\nAsh it and pass it, fuck a Dutch\nI smoke through the glass then I'm up\nI feel it in my chest, boy I ain't no stressed\nBoy this is chess motherfuck the rest\n(who are the best from the westside)\nNow let's ride down to Cali streets\nWhere them babies ain't nourished\nYoung niggas gone ride, cause them niggas got courage\nScreaming for help but nobody's heard it\nThe streets ain't got service\nGet rich or live trying word to Curtis I gotta flourish\nMan I earned it better learn it from my name down to the block\nI\u2019m a product of the I.E.

The left, or you can go right. I think a lot of people, go that traditional route, when you're raised around these things that can touch you. In a negative way, I think. For me I just saw it as a very positive, and decided to do my best not to go down the same route as a lot of my family members, unfortunately. So this is basically just the story of possibility. Of what can come, and what can happen and my rendition, if you will, of stop the violence, its also sort of an homage to KRS-One as well, thats why I threw his vocals in there.

First and foremost because the original \"Growing Pains I & II\" were on mixtapes and before this album, I did the mixtape Welcome To Forever and there was no \"Growing Pains\" from any part of the series on that. So I think a lot of people thought that \"it's over\" and that there wasn't going to be another one, and i wanted to give them that feeling of \"wow!\" \"Growing Pains III\" and all these people who heard these things on the mixtape like \"Man, he's still there. He's still Logic,\" like \"wow.\" I'm a fan, I know what it's like, and you kind of dread like \"ohh, what's that album gonna sound like?\" For me, I wanted to give them this\n\nIt opens up with a skit, and I love Wu-Tang Clan, so I always loved their skits, so it's basically about the first time I ever heard gunshots outside of my window as a little boy. And then it opens up:\n\nOutside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin'\nAnd the police they rushin'\nGo to my head like concussion\n\nAnd I'm about fifteen years old at that time, and the gunshots, I still hear them every now and then throughout my life and I'm wondering, I always used to wonder \"What caused that shootout?\" Why did I hear his? What was it? So I kind of created the fictitious tale of something that was, in fact, a true event. So that goes in, when you first hear me rapping I'm laying in bed at fifteen years old and all the things racing through my mind, from the eviction notice on my door to being on food stamps and welfare, not knowing whats going to happen tomorrow; just all the wonders. And then the beat changes up and I actually fall asleep. So this is my inner-most subconscious thoughts that I didn't even realize at the time, at fifteen years old, but now at twenty-four and looking back, reminiscing, I know that those are the things that are on my mind, because growing up in that situation, no matter what, the only time I was special, the only time I was anybody was when I was asleep. When I was asleep I was a famous basketball player, baseball player, I was a rapper/artist, I was a singer, I was an actor, I was dancer, I was an astronaut, but when I woke up I was just a boy from a broken home. That was very hard to swallow\n\nEven touching upon the lines about the television and feeling like that family, you know growing up on The Cosby's  and Family Matters, that was the closest thing I had to a real family. Once the television program turned off, or our electricity turned off [Laughs], I snapped back to reality. I didn't end it on a bright note, because there's people out there that feel that same way, so I wanted them to know that I'm with them. I'm there.

oncoming collision\nThat just make you freeze, drop to your knees and beg 'em\nPlease Lord, forgive me for gripping a semi now\nWhen searching for God all I ever do is stare up\nWhile Satan sending me women\nWearing nothing but they hair up\nGot the condom on the dresser, I can't wait to undress her\nWould you think lesser of me if I did it?\nCause I get lonely, I'm human, and boy it's been a minute\nFresh out the states, surrounded by women that wanna hit it\nBut should I take the pussy just cause I could get it?\nOr do I want something that's more committed?\nGod damn, it's hard to admit it\nAs you focus on the little things, the bigger ones will get you\nSo I minimize the negatives to see the bigger picture\nI get richer while you fuckers hate\nSo keep it up and watch a young brother elevate\nI'm black and white but racism I still cannot evade\nI never understood the concept, even to this day\nYou know we're all the same in the eyes of a blade\nBecause when men shed blood it's still the same shade\n\n[Hook]\nThat's why I'm just a man homie\nFlesh and blood, I'm just a man\nBut I don't think they understand homie\nI ain't perfect, I'm just a man\nYeah, y'all think I'm more

streets but I was closer than the curb\nDo you feel me?\u2014Whole world wanna kill me\nSigned a deal but I'm still me\u2014in five years will I still be?\nEver since I was a youngin this is all I've ever wanted\nAlways kept it real while they perpetrated and fronted\nI was in the studio while they was gettin' blunted\nAlways have my doubts but deep down I knew I'd run it\nSportin' Armani like menage a trois that's double breasted\nA lot of time I've invested and never once have I rested\nFeeling nervous like when you getting tested\nThe game is over saturated, completely infested\nThe greatest story ever told, realest song ever written\nTo hell with a Plan B, motherfucker I ain't kiddin\nI''m just trying to get this money, I'm just trying to get paid\nThat's the type of mentality put careers in the grave\nFuck how much you made\nWhat's it worth if your memory fade?\nNow I ain't perfect, on occasion I'm strayed\nIt's been forever since I prayed and I guess today is the day\nSo I step in the booth and treat that shit like a confessional\nThinking back as I reminisce\nWondering; does God even exist?\nA man of faith but mentally I feel at risk\nWhat you want from me, where am I supposed to go?\nSeems like you never talk, tell me how I'm supposed to know?\nI'm just a man, I ain't perfect\u2014is this life even worth it?\nIt's time to dig up the past so fuck it let's unearth it\nLike my childhood, living free like a child should\nRemember the time I opened the bedroom door crack?\nAnd saw my daddy smoking more crack?\nNo food in my house, we just couldn't afford that\nMomma drinking, sleeping until five\nBut she always seemed to get up whenever men arrived\nFeeling alone at like eleven\nSegregated from the other kids like it was 1957\nI've loved, I've hated, I've cried, I've died inside\nI've resurrected but don't neglect that I've modified\nI'm stronger, faster, better than ever before\nAnd everything I've been through can honestly assure\nI'm no less,

homie\nJust a youngin' tryna survive, they was hatin' on me\nI was working that nine-to-five, I was waitin', homie\nI was bussin' tables fantasizin' 'bout cakin', homie\nLetting 'em slip away my dreams, wasn't waitin' on me\nThis for anyone with ambition, calling anybody that'll listen\nI'm wishing all your dreams come true, 'cause mine did\nAnd yeah, you know I had to put that in the rhyme kit\nBut that shit came from sacrifice\nNot on the corner selling drugs and smackin' dice (listen)\nYeah\n\n[Bridge]\nSomeway, somehow, I understood finally\nIf you want to come and get it, you know where to find me\n'Cause I ain't got no time for anybody that be tryin' me\nKnow if they don't understand, I'ma leave 'em behind me\nObviously\nI ain't got no time, no, no\nI said obviously\nI said I don't got no time, no, no, no\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, yeah\nI treat the beat like it's my only son, my DNA\nAnd this that Southernplayalistic shit like we was in the A\nBack in the day, I was Young, Broke & Infamous\nA Young Sinatra that was Undeniable\nWho Welcome-d you To Forever while Under Pressure\nAnd told you The Incredible True Story of Bobby Tarantino\nAnd Everybody in the Ultra 85\nGoddamn, it feel good to be alive\nAnd all these bitches that I passed up\nCouldn't fuck witcha 'cause your hair was too gassed up\n'Member creeping with the gat, masked up\n\n[Interlude]\nGod damn, it's kinda crazy to reminisce on all this shit man\nWhat it was like growing up\nDamn man, just, motherfuckers running in and out of the crib, Doing drugs, selling drugs, all types of stuff\nMeanwhile, I was just tryna keep it together\nI was tryna make sense\u2014sense of all this shit around me\nI didn't know how to take it, how to perceive it, you know what I mean?\nAnd then meanwhile I'm supposed to be going to school and getting good grades and shit\nBut I'm seeing like, domestic violence in my house\nAnd just, so much going on\nAnd I'm sure everybody was probably like, \"Man, yo\"\n\n[Verse 3]\n\"Why little Bobby didn't come to school today?\"\nOn the real, I was doin' anything to run away\nAnd that's the same reason kids join gangs every day\n'Cause they wanna be accepted, but at home they too neglected\nMeanwhile, white America quick to call him a thug\nBut all he ever wanted was a father to give him some love\nTell him that he love him, that he need him\nPromise he won't ever leave him\nNever smoke crack, never lie, and won't never beat him\nIt feel like for my life I been needed a break\nLooking at my family, I ain't wanna make the same mistake\nAnd I know that shit sound fucked up but they not all doin' great\nOh God, please\nCan I have a conversation with a member of my family without it ending asking me for five G's?\nTo pay they bills or they lawyer fees (huh)\nI learned something, I ain't giving y'all a dime\nI'll give you something worth more\u2014that's my time\nI ain't dropping stacks, I'm dropping knowledge\nUnless it's for my nieces and nephews to go to college\nAnd hit me on the phone, hit me up\nLike, \"Uncle Bob, where you at?\nYeah, I know your pockets fat but I don't give a fuck 'bout that\nI'm glad we family\" (uh)\nWe a half-breed family, yeah, yeah, uh\n\n[Interlude]\nMan, see, I remember when I was like fifteen years old\nAnd my dad took me to the studio\nI know this is random, I'm tryna take you guys through it, right?\nAnd, I'll

first time, yo\nI was like tenth grade, in the studio\nAnd I knew that this was what I wanted to do\nI knew it\n\n[Verse 4]\nI knew it ever since I first saw Kill Bill\nI been flowin' like that blood, Uma Thurman spilled\nNone other than the RZA, yeah he did the soundtrack\nAnd then I discovered Wu-Tang soon as I found that\nAnd then Big L, Mos Def, and Nas, it wouldn't no turning back\nI couldn't change it if I tried, homie, how 'bout that?\nSee, I'm a student of the game, so simple and plain\nBut I'ma to take it back to before I ever sat first class on a plane\n\n[Interlude]\nI was in College Park, right?\nWell I guess, technically, if you wanna go before that\nI was uh, I was living in Germantown\nUh, nah, actually it was Montgomery Village\nBack in Maryland, I was living in my sister's basement\nAnd then some shit happened, you know, she kicked me out\nIt was Christmas, whatever, I love you Genie\nAnyway, so shit happened, and then I just kept it pushing\nYou know, I was homeless for a little while, whatever, you know\nI went, uh, I stayed at my\u2014my mentor's house, Solomon\nUh, and then I stayed back at my\u2014my godparents' house\nMary Jo and Bernie, I love y'all\nUh, Mary Jo, I'm sorry, back when I used to smoke\nI would steal the shit out of your cigarettes\nI love you, I'm sorry about that, but\nYou remember\u2014always she would let me record\nI'd always be recording in the attic or wherever I could, so\nI love you\u2014thank you for supporting me there\nBut then, she was like, \"You gotta get the fuck outta here\" too\nAfter a while, she gave me some time\nBut like, I was twenty years old at this point\nShe was like, \"Nah, you gotta get the fuck outta here and do something with your life\"\nAnd this was right around the time that I opened up my first show ever for Ghostface Killah man\nIn Gaithersburg, right in Old Town\nThe shit was insane, I'll never forget it\nAnd that's where I met my boy Lenny, Big Lenbo, wassup!?\nThat's right, man, we just started kicking it and hanging\nHe lived in College Park, and before I knew it I was living\u2014I was living with him in his basement\nAnd this was right around the time I met 6ix\nAnd 6ix was going to the University of Maryland at the time, which was right down the street\nSo I'd always go to their dorm room\nI remember\u2014there was nights I would just crash in the dorm when we was

his mother was racist, which is crazy\n'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have\nAll these black babies with black men but you racist\nLike bitch, that don\u2019t make no sense, but it is what it is\nYou know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger\nThe kids at school callin' him a cracker\nIdentifying as black, looking as white\nBeing told what you can or can\u2019t be\nThis kid went through everything\nHe went through...\nHe saw narcotics in the household\nViolence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped\nThere was crazy shit that happened to this kid\nAnd he persevered while the whole world said\nWhat they said?\nSaid you wouldn\u2019t be shit!\nYou ain\u2019t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'\nNothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing\nAnd I, and he, he said fuck that, I\u2019ma persevere\nAnd that\u2019s why the message is always peace, love and positivity\nSee, he always saw things from two sides\nHe always saw things from two sides\nHe always knew that the message\nEverybody was born equal\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\nHe knew that because he saw that\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way)\nBecause he was stripped and torn down\nBy his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated\nAnd that did not know\nAnd he was stripped and he was torn down\nBy his white side that did not know\nThese people that are ignorant\nThat cannot see the bigger picture\nThat must fight and kill and murder each other\nBut once again, all he ever wanted to do\nWas spread a message of equality\nFor every man, woman, and child\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first)\nNow imagine this

where the money at?\"\nYeah, that's what he say, \"Little boy, you know you know I saw you on a PJ\nWhen you gon' fly me out, when you gon' smoke me out?\"\nAlways throw demands out, motherfuck a

It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you\u2019re doing, it doesn\u2019t matter what it is\u2014somebody is interested in everything\u2014anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are...\n\nBut, it\u2019s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don\u2019t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track.
