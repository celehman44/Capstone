vet\nShoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set\nAll up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night\nShe gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg\nShe gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see\nShe ain't ready for it\nIf I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it\nThat mean I'm way up (way up)\nYeah, the 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up\nThis shit a mothafuckin' lay up\nI been Steph Curry with the shot\nBeen cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy\n360 with the wrist, boy\nWho the fuck them niggas is, boy?\nOVO, man, we really with

that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit\nI'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit\nAll up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer\nWasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker\nSo now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones\nEither that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups\nMan, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture\nComeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger\nI got 40 in the studio, every night, late night\nGotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker\nThat's my nigga\nOh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it\nI mean we can really get it, we can go for it\nI'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga\nDon't make me kill one of the GOATs for it\nI run this shit, they like, \"Go Forrest\nRun Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest\"\nYeah, I mean you already wrote for us\nDamn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?\nOh Lord, who else soundin' like this?\nThey ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this\nI was ready... fuck that, I've been ready\nSince my dad used to tell me\nHe was comin' to the house to get me\nHe ain't show up\nValuable lesson, man, I had to grow up\nThat's why I never ask for help\nI'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself\n\n[Outro]\nI go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick\nReal quick, whole squad on that real shit\n0 to 100, nigga, real quick\nReal quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga\n0 to 100, nigga, real

to watch another nigga at the top\nYou know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg\nDamn, okay, from that perspective\nI see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that\n'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at\nBut maybe I ain't lose 'em at all\nMaybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant\nThey ain't movin' at all\nBut when they need a favor, who do they call?\nMaybe I'm searchin' for the problems\nAskin' what was said and who was involved\nToo focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong\nThey say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on\nThese days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em\nWhoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough\nI'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em\n'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'\nNo pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air\nHeaded where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?\nThey tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care\nBein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware\nListen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'\nWe already got spring 2015 poppin'\nPND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'\nMajid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'\nFeel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game\nMe and Noel been at it before Twitter names\nYeah, been on the move like the lease is up\nAnd I can't even name one person that's keepin' up\nDamn, fuck how it was in the past tense\nAsk yourself, how do we match up now?\n'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better\nIf I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real\n\n[Outro: James Blake]\nCould it be the way that I'll catch up\nCould it be the way that I'll catch up\nCould it be the way that I'll catch up\nCould it be the way that I'll catch up\nCould it

I'm the man baby what is the confusion\nAnd if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then\nAnd keep sleeping while I sell a couple million\nI'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the

the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was \"Pon de Replay,\" and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called \"Work.\"\n\nToday the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.\n\nCaptivating from day one, the iconic being known as Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them that's often a peak, but for her that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.\n\nWhen it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.\n\nWhat's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.\n\nThis woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one.\n\nShe's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry.

mentioned\nMind over matter never worked for my nemesis\nI'm in the matter of man arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt\nWhen I said the music business was all I needed\nWhen I got it I was greeted by an alien\nThat said last year that she slept with a Canadian\nThat gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz\nBright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend\nMy vice is similar, women love when you're my type\nAnd you're winnin' from everything that your palm write\nPut her in the Palms Hotel, sin city\nDevil in a dress, Platinum Chanel, live the ambiance all\n'Cause the audience one day said I would do it\nSo instead of a verse bein' read\nI'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music\nI tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, Capitalize That\nAnd your weave look good with the Indian tracks\nTrackin' device on your used 5 series\nI don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian\nThe same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto\nHit me on the cellular thought he was gonna sell me\nA false word like the rappers I know\nSat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us\nA white waitress on standby when we need her\nA black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep\nNo doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah\nFelt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix\nWe talk casually about the industry\nAnd how the women be the taste makers for the shit we makin'\nThen he said that he was the same age as\u2026 myself\nAnd it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient\nSo blame it on Mr. OVOXO\nThe reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know\nThe reason why my best friend said she love me more than life\nBut I live a double life and need to let her go\nThe reason why the highlight was when he said:\nYou belong to the people when you're outside\nSo dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy\nFull of fame and bury yourself alive, then I died", "year": "2011-11-15"}, {"artist": "Drake", "album": "Take Care",

Winter\nBut listen\n\n[Verse 1: Drake]\nI met this new girl late June or early July\nI called her a bunch of times but she barely replied\nNow it's December, I'm driving, and she's like \"Where's my hi?\"\nIt's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy\nSee that was a segue, I believe the matter\nIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter\nWhere the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up\nDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up\nWhere girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in\nThe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in\nAnd some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing\nAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when\nBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city\nInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity\nCause mom stays up late, she seen them videos\nWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!\n\n[Drake talking]\nYeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man\nA lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one\nBut just wait, nah mean, take it slow\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nForget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach\nShe lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet\nSince I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite\nShe doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat\nShe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat\nShe's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet\nThen she says \"I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat\nI mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat\nI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good\nThere's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat\"\nOff this I'm kinda taken back for a second\nI get her number she tells me to call her after this session\nAnd so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch\nUntil we end up sexin' and now my heart attached\nI'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern\nAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!\n\n[Drake talking]\nYeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right\nUh, ya man, it's what it is\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nAnd now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench\nShe love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench\nBut, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown\nAnd I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench\nShe tellin everyone I'mma hold here down\nTell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town\nAnd stupid me I just listen to her\nInstead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round\nBut then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch\nThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed\nWhen we were together it seeming like way back when\nBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in\nSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa\nInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana\nAnd it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime\nI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime\n\n[Bridge (Drake talking)]\nI miss you, most of all, my darling [Beat fades out]\n(give me a second to gather my thoughts)\n[Fades back in] Strolling in the park (Ho!)\nAnd watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man)\n(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?)\nStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing\n(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss)\n(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)\n\n[Verse 4: Drake]\nI remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up\nNow Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup\nSo we can get back to them cognac nights\nWith dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right\nAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild\nThe winter came and blew his cold air through\nBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her\nBy the end of the week I would know that crew\nAnd we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene\nWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine\nAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin'\nWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen\nBut this Summer is different it's a two man operation\nGranted the fact that we one man short\nGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation\nCause handlin' crack is a one man sport\nInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin'\nI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin'\nThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes\nI'm still solo and a long night draws to a close\nCause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside\nWe'll never talk again, scary and true\nThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified\nIt's what I'm lookin for to carry me through\nYet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it\nOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit\nAnd when they talk about they past and lovers\nAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others\nYet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride\nThere's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive\n\n[Voice]\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park, and

vocal about how much you care about your hometown of Toronto and how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision, and that ultimate responsibility?\n\nDrake:\n\nYeah, I mean, I think that for the last week and a half I\u2019ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he\u2019s in. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a better way to deal with it than how he just did. I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing, I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way, was courageous and was just, to me, I think it\u2019s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation.\n\nI\u2019m just honored to know him and glad that I\u2019ve gotten to, no pun intended, witness this moment for sure. I think it\u2019s an incredible thing.  I actually woke up kind of late today, so I\u2019m just catching on. It\u2019s a great feeling for me. I can\u2019t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he\u2019s been a friend of mine for a long time.\n\nShell:\n\nObviously, you\u2019ve joined Saturday Night Live and we\u2019ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we\u2019ve seen in the past?\n\nDrake:\n\nI think obviously one of the talents that I\u2019m able to bring to the ESPYS is music, but I\u2019m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music, but I\u2019m not there to put on a strictly music\u2011based show. Yeah, we definitely have some incredible pre\u2011tapes. Yeah, I think it\u2019s just going to be a great night overall. I\u2019m there to deliver a great hosting job.\n\nShell:\n\nWhat makes the perfect ESPYS host? We\u2019ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer?\n\nDrake:\n\nWell, I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I\u2019m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don\u2019t know.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s just about knowing the room that you\u2019re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve.\n\nShell:\n\nHosting a sports awards show, what do you feel is music\u2019s role in sports?\n\nDrake:\n\nWell I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they\u2019re always super into music, whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I\u2019ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league, so I think they\u2019re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other, and I think that\u2019s what really ties music and sports together.\n\nShell:\n\nThis is a question for the producer, and if possible I have a follow\u2011up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN, was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS? Did anybody reach out? Were you close?\n\nMaura Mandt:\n\nNo, there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision, it wasn\u2019t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS, I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year, and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective, and that\u2019s what you look for the host for.\n\nWe\u2019re going to be reflecting on the year, and LeBron is something that happened, so it will definitely be something that we\u2019ll address in the show. But just like in sports, we don\u2019t try to make that news happen. It unfolds.\n\nShell:\n\nDrake, in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance, and a lot of times in hip\u2011hop that\u2019s kind of also a part of rap music and it\u2019s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage, whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip\u2011hop?\n\nDrake:\n\nI think that\u2019s a funny question. I think it\u2019s a good fit. I definitely think that hip\u2011hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we\u2019re not trying to end people\u2019s careers or make people feel bad in any way, and that\u2019s kind of most of the time what problems in hip\u2011hop are about. So our night, like I said, is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports.\n\nSo, yeah, I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words, so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different.\n\nShell:\n\nYou\u2019re also being aware of public perception. For instance, you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer, right, and you so like you definitely have, I don\u2019t know how to put it, maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she\u2019ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you\u2019ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing? Everyone loved it, so can we expect that now that you\u2019ll be hosting the ESPYS?\n\nDrake:\n\nWell, I obviously don\u2019t want to give away the material. But I do have a growing affection for Skylar, and I\u2019m not sure she\u2019ll be able to make it, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I\u2019m sure, if I haven\u2019t done it already, now that I know you\u2019re looking for it, I might stick one in there, for sure. You never know.\n\nShell:\n\nOne of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build\u2011up.  Today, I don\u2019t know if you realize this, but you\u2019ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means?\n\nDrake:\n\nWell, as far as the latter end of the question, I\u2019d rather not comment on it, but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited.\n\nWe\u2019ve been working hard, like I said, on the pre\u2011tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night, which I can 100% guarantee it will.\n\nShell:\n\nIs Cleveland your new favorite sports city? How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins, Manziel, and LB James into your ESPY segment?\n\nDrake:\n\nFirst of all, I\u2019d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks, I do not team jump. I\u2019ve been \u2011\u2011 in the past, I\u2019ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it\u2019s the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer, whether it comes to football or obviously basketball, I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams.\n\nSo it\u2019s not that I\u2019m team jumping, I\u2019m just a supportive friend. With the recent news, of course I\u2019m going to go \u2011\u2011 of course I\u2019m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron, who like I said has been a brother to me for years, I mean, we\u2019ve got three kids from Toronto on one team, plus we have Manziel who, again, is part of our family and like a brother.\n\nSo I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best.\n\nBut, yeah, like I said, my teams will always forever be who they are, but, yes, I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland, a place that I\u2019ve been time and time again touring, I just think it\u2019s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they\u2019re just a supportive group of people, and it is a great place, so I\u2019m really excited.\n\nShell:\n\nSo the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you\u2019re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music? You have a lot to write about now that you\u2019re a bachelor again.\n\nDrake:\n\nWell, actually, my status hasn\u2019t changed, just to clear that up. I\u2019ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that, the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something, I don\u2019t let my focus stray.\n\nSo for Maura to give me this opportunity to host, I don\u2019t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be \u2011\u2011 to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show, and then from there, I have things coming up, whether it\u2019s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne, which is a real thing, which a lot of people don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a real thing or not, but it\u2019s very real and it\u2019s going to be very competitive. And then from there, I\u2019ll figure out the next steps for me.\n\nI\u2019m always working on new music, but the ESPYS is the main focus right now, and we\u2019ll figure out what\u2019s next afterwards.\n\nShell:\n\nOne thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you\u2019re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne.  With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience, can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show?\n\n\nDrake:\n\nYeah, I\u2019m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance, and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character, especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So, yes, I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS, and they\u2019re good. I\u2019m excited.  They\u2019re great.\n\nShell:\n\nAre you bringing your lint roller?\n\nDrake:\n\nOh, yes. I think I\u2019ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn\u2019t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in, maybe we would have used the joke. No, I think I\u2019ll be lint\u2011free that night. I\u2019ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit.\n\nShell:\n\nSo we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits, and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they\u2019re going to wear?\n\nDrake:\n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure what brands I\u2019m going to be wearing. Right now I\u2019m sort of still, like I said, very focused on the show. I\u2019ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I\u2019ll be wearing. But I\u2019m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I\u2019ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that\u2019s really what my main focus is, but I\u2019ll get my suits together.\nI\u2019m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won\u2019t have to say anything.\n\nShell:\n\nYou have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven\u2019t met yet that you\u2019re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you\u2019re with already given you any advice about hosting?\n\nDrake:\n\nWell, I mean, I\u2019ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know, one of my mentors who is not an athlete, but obviously Jamie Foxx, a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this, just because that performance that he gave, I believe he hosted twice or three times, oh, twice, right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music, but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I\u2019m looking forward to meeting?\nI mean, yeah, I was going to say, I\u2019ve never met Skylar. I\u2019m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up, which she probably won\u2019t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But, yeah, if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It\u2019s been all in good spirits. But, yeah, that is the one person I\u2019d like to meet.\n\nJust for that last person, I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah, Nick whatever his name is, because he didn\u2019t win, so that\u2019s how he\u2019s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is.\n\nShell:\n\nCan you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you, and how many are coming from the writing staff? Also, if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song?\n\nDrake:\n\nOh, very good double question. Well, for the first part, the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that\u2019s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We\u2019ve been at it now for three months, I think, just on and off, meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine, I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I\u2019m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music, jokes and pre\u2011taped pieces, I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it.\n\nIs writing a joke harder than writing a song? I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest, raw emotion about my life, I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it\u2019s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it.\n\nBut, yeah, I mean, all my music is so honest, that sometimes it\u2019s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you\u2019re able to be lighthearted and joke around, I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do.\n\nMandt:\n\nI\u2019d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years, one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it\u2019s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we\u2019ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what\u2019s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life, it really elevates it, so it\u2019s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved.\n\nWe had a shoot the other day from one of the skits, and on set he was coming up with stuff, and you guys will see it and know what I\u2019m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session, and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I\u2019m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.", "year": "2014-07-11"}, {"artist": "Drake", "album": "The Drought Is Over (Friends With Money)", "title": "Every Girl", "lyrics": null, "year": null}, {"artist": "Drake", "album": null, "title": "Everywhere I Go", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nHo!\nYeah!\nIt's Drake!\nTrendsetters...\nYeah!\nI love this man.

thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes\nThe honesty of my music has left me too exposed\nAll my old friends think I got a new crowd\nAnd people seem to notice every time I do smile\nI guess that mean they

white snakes to, ooh wee\nThis metaphor might sound a little confusin' but\nY'all don't really know me if you know me\nI done come all way from the Days Inn and all the hotels that I stayed in\nAnd I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin' at amazin'\nGirls tryna SoHo lobby us\nHear 'em all screamin' then it's probably is\nBut I can't blame females\nFemales can't really ignore somethin' this obvious\nWhat you really expect when I strut through town?\nTwo or three days I shut you down\nChilin' with the homie Trey Songz\nYou call him the prince, he rep two up, two down\nAnyone I know get used to me\nI'm far from the man that I used to be\nAnd I don't ever really kick game\nI know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me\n'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that\nNeed good lovin' I'm providin' that\nUnderstand that I'm worldwide\nYou get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at\n'Cause I do things from the M-town\nTo the UK\nAnd from Spain back out to Texas\nThis album's for my fans\nBut, yo, this hook is for my exes\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nThis one is for you girl, you know who you are girl\nYou only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl\nWhat you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it\nGirl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you\nYou had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you\nOh, you had a man now you don't\nBack to the basics, I think I made it\nLadies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl\n\n[Verse 2: Trey Songz]\nAin't ya never seen a youngin' so fly?\nLookin' for someone your type\nI done left behind the love of my life\nTryina find another one tonight\nAnd if it's you baby, let yourself be seen\nDon't matter skirts, dresses or jeans\nI got that work, know what I mean\nAnd I'm flexin' on my ex if you know what mean\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nThis one is for you girl, you know who you are girl\nYou only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl\nWhat you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it\nGirl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you\nYou had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you\nOh, you had a man now you don't\nBack to the basics, I think I made it\nLadies make some noise if you wanna be my replacement girl\n\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nFrom the moment she get picked for some take out\nUntil they slip up and break out\nBut it's another story over here at Drake's house\n'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out\nAnd I'm leaned back, scopin'\nLookin' for a woman that I should wife\nWho got just the right amount of loyalty\nYeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life\nWe go LA, VA, NY, TO\nSunshine and that heat stroke\nAnd them fur hoods in that deep snow\nWe have breakfast in the bedroom\nBreak bread downstairs in the basement\nSince Jay and Kellz ain't doin' they thing no more\nGuess me and the boy Songz the replacement\n\n[Hook: Trey Songz]\nThis one is for you girl, you know who you are girl\nYou only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl\nWhat you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it\nGirl, my time is limited and I ain't tryna waste it all on you\nYou had a chance, now it's gone,

dealers live vicariously through me\nI quit school and it's not because I'm lazy\nI'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy\nUnderstand, I could get money with my eyes closed\nLost some of

emotional day. I completely support and agree with Rolling Stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication. My frustration stemmed from the way it was executed. The circumstances at hand are completely justifiable (on the magazines behalf), but I was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating. They ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not. I would have waited until it was my time because I understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but I just wasn't given that option and that made me feel violated. I apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would I ever want to offend the Hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment. I am still the same person. Today I was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly. These days are the worst ones. Waking up after a great night in the studio and it's your day to be picked apart. After dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time. So here I am having that moment. I once again apologize to everybody who took my cover comments the wrong way. I respect Rolling Stone for being willing to give a kid from Toronto a shot at the cover.
