researching, I'm the King\nWith a style as mean as the Earth seem\nChest on ice, and my wrist on gleam\n30 karats in the ring, money ain't no thing\nYou think I'm playin' but I ain't joking\nThe dro king, if it ain't purple, I ain't smoking\nRubberband bank rolls, fifty thousand dollar cheddar knots\nTry to shine, is you out your mind, boy you better not\nI walk around with more money than you ever got\nShrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock\nShawty I can get you in whatever spot\nBackstage, front row, what I got to front for\nI'm getting bored, don't even know what I stunt for\nGot a lot of rides, what it hurt to cop one more\n\n[Hook - Lil' Kim, T.I.]\n\n[Verse 3 - T.I.]\nTo all my hot girls, if you wanna come chill\nOr roll on chrome wheels, let me tell you what it is\nWe fixin' throw a little party at the crib\nWhere the floors tricked out and the rooms like ill\nThe basement's cool, but the pools unreal\nWhere that millionaire lives, shit remains concealled\nSo pop a pill, put on your blindfold\nI'm hitting the dance floor, and grab eighty-nine more\nLet em' know we on the way where they been trying to go\nI knew I had em' when they asked me \"What kind of diamonds are those\"\nHeaded to the spot pouring double shots of XO\nPlay the \"Love Below\" ane watch'em undress slow\nFlicks on the flat screen, make em' want to \"Get Low\"\nAnd spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole\nWhen they kick it with the king, they don't wanna let go\nSo whatcha gonna tell a nigga, when he tell ya \"Let's Go\"\n\n[Hook x2 - Lil' Kim, T.I.]",

aganist us\nAnd lead us not into temptation\nBut deliver us from evil\nFor thine is the kingdom\nAnd the power, and the glory\nFor ever and ever, hmm, amen\n\n[Verse 1]\nMan, I'm prayin' for help\nWhile I'm lookin' at the life I left, it's kinda hard not to hate myself\nBut quiet as kept, right or wrong it's just the way I felt\nI might be better off prayin' for death, on my knees I knelt\nStill tryin' to find a way to accept, it ain't a way that I can\nHelp nobody, 'til I save myself, techinically I'm still a slave myself\nI gotta climb out the grave myself, man I played myself\nBut when I look at all the fans I touched\nI ask how can a man that's done so much, be treated so unjust\nCause I'm tryin' to inspire the folks, you wanna be them\nCause they sell dope, well man show 'em the ropes\nBe a father or a football coach, a role model or a symbol of hope\nTake another approach, instead of testifyin' aganist them in court\nHandcuffin' 'em and closin' the door, so they can be worse than before\nCan't you see they only do what they know\nThan you wonder why they don't care no mo', life ain't fair I know\nBut why I'm hated everywhere I go, next time you wanna\nCompare my flow, just know that I'm prayin' for help\n\n[Hook]\nAskin' somebody else to give me a hand\nI'm tryin' hard, but I'm only a man\nMan, I'm prayin' for help\nHopin' somebody could see what I see\nIt's like the hood only matter to me\nThey got me prayin' for help\nHopin' somebody else can carry the torch\nI'm all alone, with no kinda support\nWhile I was prayin' for help\nRealized that I don't need nobody else\nIf God wit' me I can do it myself\nI'm tired of just prayin' for help\n\n[Verse 2]\nI know it's only one king, one thing, one being\nOnly somethin' I believe without seeing, and with all my faith\nI pray some how, some way, regardless of what anyone say\nI believe one day, that I'mma change my life, get right\nStart livin' like Christ, 'til the end of my fight\nI'mma be defending my strife\n'Til somebody come and shut off my lights, I ain't never gon' quit\nNo matter how difficult it's gon' get, and you can bet whatever on this\nI'm forever gon' spit, harder than niggas hatin' on Tip\nYou can take away place it on Tip, If I double my load\nCarry it as the trouble unfolds, holds yours\nAnd I betta don't fold, put that on my soul\nIf it takes until I'mma hundred years old, bet I'm reachin' everyone of my goals\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nAy it's so many times, I done wish I could change my mind\nChange my life and leave the game behind\nAnd it's been so many days, I done prayed I could find a way\nFind a heart and the time to say, only so many are blessed\nWith so many chances, and so many checks, so many fans\nWith so many arrest, and it's been so many deaths\nSo many prisons with niggas in there\nAnd the system keep playin' them to the left, man it's so many tests\nSo many haters love seeing you stess, but tribulations come with being the best\nStill it's so many who flex, singin' for checks, when they greener than Shrek's\nSellin' dreams never seem to jex, that's why I'm seeing some threats\nSo many stripes off the streets I'mma vet, so many rappers get so little respect\nNow niggas faith on the shelf, cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt\nOr the heart that a nigga that dealt, so many niggas done left outta the hood\nMade a way for themself, instead of givin' back, they stay for they self\nSo many playin' they self, instead of readin', educating they self\nThe ones who won't even pray for they self, they got me prayin' for help\n\n[Hook]", "year": "2004-11-30"}, {"artist": "T.I.", "album": "Paperwork: The Motion Picture", "title": "Private Show", "lyrics": "[Intro: Sample]\nTake it off, chick, bend over,
