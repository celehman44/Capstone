A hundred bucks or two a week?\nDo you think that you would know what to do if you was me?\nI got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us\nIf they ain't want us why the fuck they never wore rubbers?\"\nI felt ashamed to have ever complained about my lack of gear\nAnd thought about how far we done came\nFrom trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky\nThank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry\nYou made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted\nI ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed\nNah, I'm gon' take what they owe me\nAnd show you that I can fly\nAnd show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive\nAye who am I?\n\n[Hook]\nThings change, rearrange and so do I\n(Aye who am I?)\nIt ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie\n(Who am I?)\nI get high 'cause the lows can be so cold\nI might bend a little bit but I don't fold\nOne time for my mind and two for yours\nI got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul\nIf you see my tears fall just let me be\nMove along, nothing to see\n\n[Outro]\nI never felt better", "year": "2014-12-09"}, {"artist": "J.

Cole", "album": null, "title": "Autism Speaks Apology Letter", "lyrics": "Recently there\u2019s been a trend that includes rappers saying something offensive, only to be attacked for it in the media and pressured to apologize. I have to be completely honest and say there\u2019s a part of me that resents that. I view rap similar to how I view comedy. It\u2019s going to ruffle feathers at times. It\u2019s going to go \u201ctoo far\u201d. I do not believe that an apology is needed every time someone is offended, especially when that apology is really only for the sake of saving an endorsement or cleaning up bad press.\n\nWith that said, this is not the case today. This letter is sincere.\nThis apology IS necessary.\n\nIn a recent verse on the song \u201cJodeci Freestyle\u201d, I said something\nhighly offensive to people with Autism. Last week, when I first saw a comment from someone outraged about the lyric, I realized right away that what I said was wrong. I was instantly embarrassed that I would be ignorant enough say something so hurtful. What makes the crime worse is that I should have known better.\n\nTo the entire Autism community who expressed outrage, I\u2019m moved and inspired by your passion, and I\u2019m amazed at how strong you are as a unit. I have now read stories online from parents about their struggles and triumphs with raising an Autistic child and I admire how incredibly strong you have to be to do so. It\u2019s touching. It also makes what I said even more embarrassing for me. I feel real shame. You have every right to be angry.\n\nTo anyone suffering from Autism, either mildly or severely, I am sorry. I\u2019m bound to make mistakes in my life, but in my heart I just want to spread Love.\n\nI want to educate myself more on Autism, and I\u2019ll gladly own my mistake and serve as an example to today\u2019s generation that there\u2019s nothing cool about mean-spirited comments about someone with Autism. People with this disorder and their loved ones have to go through so much already, the last thing they need is to hear something as ignorant as what I said. I understand.\n\nTo the parents who are fighting through the frustrations that must\ncome with raising a child with severe autism, finding strength and\npatience that they never knew they had; to the college student with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome; to all those overcoming Autism. You deserve medals, not disrespect. I hope you accept my sincere apology.\n\nMuch Love\n\n-Cole", "year": null}, {"artist": "J.

I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him.\"\nSo a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up\nCause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed\nBut you know, shit, everything happens for a reason\nSo shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me my nigga\nSo that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know\nAs I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes\nThank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason.

Cole", "album": null, "title": "Letter For The Fifth Anniversary Of \"The Warm Up\"", "lyrics": "5 years ago, we started a journey together. On June 15th, 2009 I released The Warm Up to a few who were waiting patiently for it. Full of my dreams, fears and predictions, it resonated with you right away. Over the next year I watched it grow legs and spread at an unbelievable pace all because you felt it so much. Five years later, I couldn\u2019t be more proud of it\u2019s impact. Thank you.\n\nThe Warm Up is a declaration of dedication to Greatness. Told from the perspective of a kid who wants more than what his city has to offer him. The crime. The stagnation. He wants more from the girls he dates. He wants out of Muhammad\u2019s house. He refuses to let anyone tell him he can\u2019t dream. That he won\u2019t make it. He believes in himself. He dedicates his life to his craft, because he\u2019s finally realized that the work that you put in today has a direct and absolute impact on the life you live tomorrow.\n\nYou heard the passion, you heard the stories, and you believed in him too. You rooted for him. And your\u2019e still rooting. My thoughts today come from my observations over the past 5 years. I understand now that you\u2019re rooting for him, rooting for me, because you are also rooting for yourself. You realize that this society kills dreams and encourages you to conform. To settle for the block, to join the army, to become a lawyer when you really want to paint, to get comfortable in the projects, to slave away at a 9-5 you hate because it pays decent; to become complacent with safety. The Warm Up says, \u201cFuck that. I will be Greater. Watch me.\u201d\n\nI think about all the times over the past few years that one of you has said to me, \u201cyou\u2019re the reason I went to college,\u201d \u201cyo, The Warm Up got me through some hard times,\u201d \u201cgot me through law school,\u201d \u201cmed school,\u201d \u201chigh school,\u201d \u201cThe Warm Up changed my life.\u201d\n\nI imagine that 5 years ago we all wanted more. The Warm Up was just something that put music and words to what we were feeling. As I write this I\u2019m on a plane from Sydney, Australia back to New York City. Music has taken me around the world now, doing shows in places I never thought I would be. I\u2019m grateful.\n\nI\u2019m wondering where you are today. 5 years later. The Warm Up dropped when some of you were upperclassmen in college. I\u2019m hoping that you\u2019ve found a career doing some shit you love, something that makes you happy. Maybe you needed more time to figure it out. Grad School? Or maybe you\u2019re back in your parents crib trying to regroup. Everything will be OK. Don\u2019t stop dreaming.\n\nSome of ya\u2019ll were still in high school. If you went on to college, enjoy it while you got it. If you went straight to the real world, I wish you the best. I hope you found a trade you love, or a job that allows you to support yourself. Happiness is all that matters. If you ain\u2019t happy, adjust please.\n\nSome of you were underclassmen in college, which means you probably just entered the workforce or you\u2019re still trying to get that entry level position. These are the toughest times. You will struggle no doubt, but it will all work out in the end.\n\nNo matter where you were 5 years ago, I hope that today you are closer to your dreams. I know that everything hasn\u2019t gone exactly the way you planned, it hasn\u2019t for me either. But our job isn\u2019t to plan. Our job includes 3 responsibilities. 1. To dream. 2. To believe that dream is attainable. And 3. To work hard everyday towards that dream. Let God handle the rest.\n\nAs you go throughout this week replaying this project that changed my life and lots of yours too, I want to leave you with this because I feel we all need it. Read this as if these words were yours, because they are.\n\nIn 5 years I have come so far. I am grateful to be here today, alive and full of potential. But I am not satisfied. I still want more. I still have dreams, even bigger now than before. I will not settle or conform. I rededicate myself to greatness. I give my time and my passion to my craft, because I realize that the work I put in today affects the life that I live tomorrow. I believe in myself. And to all those that doubt me I say, \u201cFuck that. I will be Greater. Watch me.\u201d\n\n- Cole", "year": "2014-06-15"}, {"artist": "J.

Where am I gon' get that money?\nI refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world\nWhen I ain't got shit to give 'em, and I'm not with them niggas\nWho be knockin' girls up and skate out\nSo, girl, you gotta think about how the options weigh out\nWhat's the way out?\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I ain't too proud to tell you\nThat I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it\nAnd girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect\nThen we could make it work, but I doubt it\nAnd I ain't too proud to tell you\nThat I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it\nAnd girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect\nThen we could make it work, but I doubt it\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe said: \"Nigga, you got some nerve\nTo come up to me talkin' about abortion\nThis my body, nigga, so don't think you finna force shit!\nSee, I knew that this is how you act, so typical\nSaid you love me, oh, but now you flippin' like reciprocals\nIt figures though, I should've known\nThat you was just another nigga\nNo different from them other niggas\nWho be claimin' that they love you just to get up in them drawers\nKnowin' all the right things to say\nI let you hit it raw, mothafucka!\nNow I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?\nTryna take away a life\u2014is you God, mothafucka?!\nI don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach\nRegardless if I'm your wife, this new life here, I'ma love it\nI ain't budgin', I just do this by my mothafuckin' self\nSee, my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help\nFrom a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that\nDid you forget all those conversations that we had way back\n'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga\nTalkin' about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga\n\u2018Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit\nAnd here you go doin' the same shit\u2026 You ain't shit, nigga!\"\n\n[Hook]\nAnd I ain't too proud to tell you\nThat I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it\nAnd boy, this shit hurts, and ain\u2019t nobody perfect\nStill we can make it work, but you doubt it\nAnd I ain't too proud to tell you\nThat I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it\nAnd boy, this shit hurts, and ain\u2019t nobody perfect\nStill we can make it work, but you doubt it\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey say everything happens for a reason\nAnd people change like the seasons, then grow apart\nShe wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her\nHe spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her\nNow she wide open\nShe'd put a ring up on his finger if she could\nBut he loved her \u2018cause the pussy good\nBut she ain't no wife though\nUh-oh! She tellin' him she missed her period, like typos\nHe panickin', froze up like a mannequin, a life grows\nInside her, and now he askin': \"Is it even mine?\"\nWhat if this bitch ain't even pregnant? Dog, could she be lyin'?\nAnd she be cryin', \u2018cause he actin' distant\nLike, \"Ever since I told you this, nigga, you actin' different.\"\nAnd all his niggas sayin', \"Man, these hoes be trappin' niggas\nPlayin' with niggas' emotions like they some action figures.\"\nSwear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion\nMan, if that bitch really pregnant, tell her to get a abortion\nBut what about your seed, nigga?\n\n[Outro]\nAnd I ain't too proud to tell you\nThat I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it\nAnd I ain't too proud to tell you\nThat I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it", "year": "2011-09-27"}, {"artist": "J.

My question is why did you create the website stream for the album before it even came out?\n\nCole - so fans didn't feel so bad for listening early\n2. What did your homie who was disappointed your first Dead Presidents freestyle think of the second one?\n\nCole - he was silenced forever. wasn't my homie, knew him through somebody else. but he's on Mute now\n3. If there was one thing you could've done differently music-wise, what would it have been?\n\nCole - sell Friday night lights\n4. What is one musician you love that most people would not expect you to listen to?\n\nCole - Eric Clapton\n5. Hearing that you're a big Outkast fan i'll ask you this; ATLiens or Aquemini?\n\nCole - DAMN. That's tough. But Aquemini\n6. Can you speak on your favorite track on Born Sinner?\nCan you speak on your production process you took on Born Sinner?\n\nCole - First answer! Favorite song is too hard to decide. But I will say Runaway is definitely in the running. The verses!\nProduction process is an easier question to answer for me. I just let it FLOW. Normally I start out by finding drum sounds and patterns that make me move. for instance, Runaway started by flipping a real dirty drum loop, then adding a harder kick on top. Once i get drums that Move me and excite me, I look to add music (samples or something i'm playing) that make the marriage complete\nBorn sinner plays with a lot of Double time tempo's. Shit like power trip, that moves your head as if it's fast paced. but in reality, its technically a SLOW beat. The breakdown on LAnd of the Snakes another example. Or rich niggas\nThanks for the question\n7. What internet sites do you frequent, non-music related?\n\nCole - can i be honest? without getting killed off by Reddit community. I go to Digg a lot. I know Reddit ethered Digg a while ago, because of the amazing COMMUNITY experience of reddit. But I still rock with them\nDon't taze me bro\n8. Why wasn't the beat that was used in the first Born Sinner uStream used on the album?\n\nCole - Didn't like the verses on it! they were hard but sometimes a beat is so good it's overpowering and intimidating. that beat is like that\n9. What did you have for lunch today?\nAlso, what's your favourite music video?\nYo i got another one, what's your favourite kind of booze?\n\nCole - haven't eaten yet today. you just reminded me that i need to eat\n10. Have you received any feedback (positive/negative) about your \u201cFaggot\u201d bars on Villuminati?\n\nCole - yes. i'm a communications major, studied PR. I knew what I was getting into. The comment I gave to Huffington Post was genuine and the reason why I wrote those bars. The line even makes me uncomfortable, but it's worth it for the sake of the conversation\n11.  What was the most meaningful song on Born Sinner?\nTo me it felt like you poured your heart out and went all in on this album. Love the work. Keep it coming, you're for real, man. Changing the game..\n\nCole - There is a lot of MEANING on the album. so most meaningful is hard. But I really love the title track \"Born Sinner.\" Because even though there's lots of pitfalls, temptations, dangers, and tribulations on the album, it ends in a hopeful place with \"i'm a born sinner, but i'll die BETTER than that\" listen to those verses for more clarity. plus i touch on the things that are really important to me. relationship (got her life in my grip), family (she hate the way she raised me but she loved what she raised), friends (if i died today my nigga was it business, was it personal?)\nThank you\n12. Kid Cudi self-produced the whole album, Indicud, like you did on Born Sinner. What is you personal opinion on INDICUD?\n\nCole - I haven't heard INDICUD because I was working on my album. But I'm really mad at myself for not finishing a verse for that album in time. Got in the studio with Cudi and he was cool as shit. Good dude. I never did my verse and the joint was harddd\n13. One thing that I think everyone here wants to ask: Can you tell us anything new about your upcoming album with Kendrick Lamar? I really love Born Sinner by the way, can't wait to see where you go next, but I want to emphasize how good what you're doing right now is. And thanks for doing this AMA!\n\nCole - Thank you. This question will be asked a lot so I'll just answer it here. We have some really good songs in the stash, but haven't had a chance to properly work on a project. An album will come in the future, but probably not this year. I'm just happy for my niggaaa\n14. How did it feel when you heard Nas on Let Nas Down Remix?\n\nCole - Surreal. Today is my first day off in a LONG TIME (other than this. but this isn't WORK) I plan on soaking in that moment tonight and really reflecting on how amazing that is\n15. What made you want to work with James Fauntleroy? He is incredible\n\nCole - This is weird. You asked me a question. And then answered your own question\n16. did you have a fan base before you you got signed?\n\nCole - yes. i called them friends\nThat was it really. few hundred people had heard The Come Up, and School Daze was popping on my myspace page. No buzz though. Just skeelz\n17. Favorite nba team?\n\nCole - no real team loyalty. just follow players now. Looking for a home. my last favorite team was the KNICKS because Penny Hardaway's last real playing years were there (and i just happened to be in NYC for college). Before that it was the Magic, then the Suns. NEVER FAVORITE A TEAM BECAUSE OF A PLAYER, when he leaves you're gonna be lost in the world\n18. So....have you met Jay Electronica? How's he like?\nWho's your favorite celebrity that you've met/would like to meet?\n\nCole - jay electronica has the most phone numbers out of anybody i ever met. He changes his number every 16 hours\n19. How did you celebrate the release of born sinner?\nCole world\n\nCole - got twisted tuesday night with friends and fam in NYC while feeling really grateful and relieved and blessed and happy\n20. COLE I HOOKED YOU UP WITH THAT GIANT BORN SINNER PIC BY YOUR NAME, PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE YA BOY'S EXISTENCE\n\nCole - acknowledged\n21. Congratulations on Nas's remix to your joint Cole!\nListening to your songs I often get chills. Songs such as God's Gift, Return of Simba, See it to Believe it and too many songs off of Born Sinner! Has there ever been a song you've heard whether it be from Nas or someone else that has blown your mind and influenced your style greatly?\n\nCole - Nas- Undying Love Eminem- Stan just mind blowing concepts tons more of course from more than just those rappers\n22. Why Did you try and compete with Kanye on the 18th? Wouldn't it make more sense to have your album release on a day with less competition?\n\nCole - Just followed my instincts. I was confident in the album I had. Didn't know what he had, but didn't care. Wanted to start the conversation. I've had a #1 album before. It's cool. But I wouldn't have been able to live with myself wondering \"what if I would have moved my date?\"\n23. Hi J. Cole. I have a few questions for you but first off I would like to say thank you for taking time out of your day to do an AMA here on HipHopHeads. I've been a big fan of yours ever since my friend at school introduced me to some of your songs last year. I really wanted to come to your Atlanta show a couple of days ago and support you and buy some merchandise but I found out that there was an age limit, and I am only 15\nWhat are your favorite things to do outside of rapping?\nWhat job would you like to have if you didn't rap?\nWhat has been the hardest part of your rapping career so far?\nDo you think of yourself as \"famous\" now that you have had two successful albums?\nAre you going to be releasing any winter merchandise for Born Sinner? I would really like to have a hoody with the album art on it and wear it all around my campus\nThanks again for doing this AMA, I am looking foward to future album and mixtape releases\n\nCole - If I didn't rap I have no clue what I would want to do. Would take a lot of self re-evaluating to figure that out. Too much passion for music to think of something else right now\nHardest part of my rap career so far was finding the balance. How to become a mainstream artist without losing myself. Took a lot of experimenting, trying things, sometimes failing. But I found it\nBorn Sinner CROWN Hoodies on the way\n24. What did yourself and Drake do with all those copies of the album you bought?\nWhat was your first feeling when the album leaked so far in advance?\n\nCole - I don't even know what happened to those copies. Hopefully they gave them out to the people\nMy first feeling when the album leaked 12 DAYS IN ADVANCE. was \"oh fuck\"\n25. Thank you for doing this AMA J. Cole, to see my favorite rapper come to my favorite online community is really something special\n3 days before Sideline Story dropped I was at your concert in Tampa, and you shouted me out at the end while doing Farewell, I was the white kid wearing a Dreamville shirt, here's a picture of me from that night http://imgur.com/dtNJLZ1 When you have your next concert in Tampa, or the closest other venue, I plan on wearing a shirt that says \"Produce with J. Cole or Die Trying\" I would really just like to get some advice on producing, it's become something I love to do, and you are amazing at it\nAnyways, my question for you is how does it feel to have your idol, Nas, rap over your own song, saying that he is proud of you?\nThank you once again, I've been a fan since The Warm Up, and your music has gotten me through some very hard times. Sorry for fan girling, but I've seen in interviews how you've talked about how much you liked Nas as a kid where it felt like you knew him, and that's exactly how I feel about you. Keep making amazing music, and thank you for helping bring back the real\n\nCole - thank you. i'm going to do a real tour in the fall\nI answered the Nas question. Really just wanted to say thank you for listening. And I just heard we beat Edward Snowden for #1 on Reddit. AND I AIN'T HAVE TO BETRAY THE US GOVERNMENT!!! jk jk jk jk (does anyone still use jk.. felt like a 12 year old girl typing that)\n26. What are your favorite shows on TV? (More importantly, do you watch Breaking Bad?) lol\n\nCole - Newsroom is my favorite show. House of Cards too. Breaking Bad is incredible, I only saw the first 2 episodes and planned on watching every episode of every season to catch up. But never had time. So NO, I don't watch it but wish I could\n27. Hey Cole. Born sinner is easily the best album that came out on June 18th and your production and rapping was on point. I got two questions for you\n1) Why did you decide to not have any guest features spit a verse on Born sinner?\n2) When can we expect your collab album with Kendrick?\nThanks for doing this ama Cole!\n\nCole - Thank you! By the time I was wrapping up the album, I started doing interviews and getting questions about features. I didn't have any rap features, and I felt pressure to ADD some, but quickly realized that I had already said what I wanted to say on this album. The mentality was \"who says you HAVE to have other people rapping on your album?\"\n\n2) Don't want to put a date on it\n28. If you could, would you have done Born Sinner differently?\n\nCole - nope", "year": null}, {"artist": "J.
