It\u2019s how you write it, the structure, it depends how you write it, and as to whether it has a beat, I guess it won\u2019t sell as much if you don\u2019t have a beat; the beat is more of a selling tool\n\nPolice \u2013 Now, you were performing by the time you did your solo-album what people call \u201cgangsta rap\u201d.,\n\n2Pac \u2013 No\n\nPolice \u2013 You were not?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No!\n\nPolice \u2013 What would you call what you were performing?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Rap music!\n\nPolice \u2013 Have you ever performed gangsta rap?\n\n2Pac \u2013 No!\n\nPolice \u2013 Okay, and why would you say that?\n\n2Pac \u2013 Because, Number One, I do not know what \u201cgangsta rap\u201d, is, number two, I would not classify what my music is as gangsta rap\n\nPolice \u2013 Have you heard the term?\n\n2Pac \u2013 A lot!\n\nPolice \u2013 Okay\n\nPolice \u2013 The next statement is a \u201cVictim for Real\u201d : \u201cI really got my ass beat, I really don\u2019t like police\u201d\n\n2Pac \u2013 I didn\u2019t say that.

Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr. Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's \u2013 excuse me \u2013 Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from \"Hawaiian Sophie\" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release.

man can't make one\nHe has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one\nSo will the real men get up?\nI know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up\n\n[Hook]\nKeep ya head up, ooh,

always had enough\nI huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules\nRan with a local crew and had a smoke or two\nAnd I realize Mama really paid the price\nShe nearly gave her life to raise me right\nAnd all I had to give her was my pipe dream\nOf how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen\nI'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents\nIt's hard to be legit and still pay the rent\nAnd in the end it seems I'm headin' for the pen\nI try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind\nLast night my buddy lost his whole family\nIt's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity\nIt seems the rain'll never let up\nI try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up\nYou know, it's funny, when it rains it pours\nThey got money for wars but can't feed the poor\nSay there ain't no hope for the youth\nAnd the truth is it ain't no hope for the future\nAnd then they wonder why we crazy\nI blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby\nWe ain't meant to survive, \u2018cause it's a set-up\nAnd even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up\n\n[Hook]\nKeep ya head up, ooh, child\nThings are gonna get easier\nKeep ya head up, ooh,

they own\nI know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone\nDaddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome\nThank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em\n\u2018Cause I think we can make it; in fact, I'm sure\nAnd if you fall, stand tall and come back for more\n\u2018Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son\nWants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'\nYou can't complain you was dealt this\nHell of a hand without a man, feelin' helpless\nBecause there's too many things for you to deal with\nDyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless\nWhile tears is rollin' down your cheeks\nYou steady hopin' things don't fall down this week\n\u2018Cause if it did, you couldn't take it\nAnd don't blame me \u2014 I was given this world, I didn't make it\nAnd now my son's gettin' older and older\nAnd colder from havin' the world on his shoulders\nWhile the rich kids is drivin' Benz\nI'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends\nAnd it's crazy, it seems

chance\nWalked her to the parkin' lot for a little romance\nGot to my car, put the key in the ignition\nTurned on the slow jams, I was on a mission\nI was catchin' wild things like the chicken pox\nI was \"J\" and knockin' boots right down the socks\nShe was freaky and wild, oh man could I call it?\nBut when I dropped her off, she had stole my wallet\nI couldn't quite believe that why a hoocher-coocher?\nBut that was my first experience with MINNIE THE MOOCHER!!\n\n[2Pac]\nMinnie the Moocher was a legend on the block I'm from\nA dream girl to many brothers, but true to none\nHer reputation was enormous - a real go getter\nAnd once a brother met her, he wanted to get with her\nMaybe it was her smile, her personality or\nThe way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore\nBut whatever it was, Minnie the Moocher was an expert\nReal heart-breaker, but never get hurt\nShe had this boyfriend, his name was Diamond\nHelpin' Minnie out with the little social climbin'\nMet with Politicians, peace to many others\nSuddenly and instantly, they became her lovers\nShe took the power that they possessed\nAnd Minnie did it all without gettin' undressed\nMinnie dissed Diamond sayin' that he could not live with her\nBut he wanted payment for the things he did for her\nHe grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand\nMinnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right hand\nShe was a legend to everyone who knew her\nThat's is my memory of Minnie the Moocher\n\n[Ray Tyson]\nMinnie had a boyfriend, a gambler\nAddicted to poker, an alcoholic, a basshead, crack smoker\nHe took her to Harlem, and all around Chinatown\nHe bought some bass, a pipe a tape of hard-rap sounds\nShe was an addict, tired of the static and poverty\nSick of the same ghetto misery\nSee, Minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement\nSmokey was a hoodlum, headin' for inditement\nThen one day their relationship stopped\nWhen Smokey was killed by the M-I-C-Cops\nMinnie was hurt, lost without a clue\nTo her, there was no chance of gettin' somebody new\nSo she walked home sadly, as bad as it seems\nShe cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams\n\n[Ray Tyson]\nShe had dreams and schemes about the King of Sweden\nHe gave her things that this girl was much needin'\nA plush house made of gold and steel\nA diamond car with a platt in the wheel\nNow you might think this is a lot of stuff\nBut to Minnie this was not enough\nHe bought a stable, full of thorough-bred race horses\nHis meal she ate was a dozen courses\nShe had a fortune in nickels and dimes\nAnd she sat around and counted it a billion times\nShe had bank, yeah Minnie was clockin'\nHad every sucker in the neighborhood JOCKIN'!!\nShe would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye\nThen she dissin', with zero reply", "year": null},

unforgiven\nAnd all the Hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside\nYou know, it's like I'm livin just to die\nI fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowing if I'm worthy\nLiving life thinking no man can hurt me...\n\nWe continue growing, one day at a time...\nWe continue growing, one day at a time...\nWe continue growing, one day at a time...", "year": null}, {"artist": "2Pac",

She\u2019s not here, but I gotta give a peace out to her. Because I wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for my mother.\n\nI looked on the front of this thing, and it said, \u201cStart from within to rebuild our original greatness,\u201d right? OK, well, that\u2019s what my mother did, know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019. And I\u2019m listening about freedom fighters and strugglers, and you gotta understand that  when it was in to have a gun and be in the street, my mother gave that up to be in the house and wash the dishes and feed us and put the thoughts in our brains. Because we didn\u2019t get any of that history from any of those soldiers that we lost--we got none of that. They all went to jail, if you can remember. They all went to penitentiaries. We didn\u2019t see none of that knowledge. If it was not for my mother, who stayed home and didn\u2019t go out and do all that, then I wouldn\u2019t have had shit--excuse my language. But I wouldn\u2019t have been nowhere.\n\nSo, what I want to do, hopefully, is, I want to be--I am--Tupac Shakur. I have to be a reminder that it ain\u2019t time to cool out, banquets and all that--it\u2019s still on. It\u2019s on just like it was when you were young. And you want to say \u201cfuck that\u201d just like you said \u201cfuck that\u201d back then. So how come now that I\u2019m 20 years old, ready to start some shit up, everybody\u2019s telling me to calm down. You know, don\u2019t curse, go to school, go to college...well, fuck that. We\u2019ve had colleges for a while now, now i'm saying, and there\u2019re still Brenda\u2019s out there, and nigga\u2019s is still trapped.

It\u2019s not gonna stop until we stop it.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just white men that\u2019s doing this to Brenda, and it\u2019s not just white men that\u2019s keeping us trapped. It\u2019s black, you know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019? We have to find the new African in everybody, in all of us. Because if we keep running around looking for black and who got the most colors on and who got the baddest dashiki on, we still gonna get--and excuse my language--fucked.\n\nIt irks me right now that my mother is going through, you know, she has to get clean.  This is somebody I watched travel the whole country, during the time when women were scared to speak up for the Black Panthers. She spoke at Harvard, Yale, everywhere, and now I see my mother as what\u2019s really going on, and I don\u2019t see no big parades around my mother now. And she done got dozens of fucking awards. And I don\u2019t see nobody there. You understand what I\u2019m saying? So about all this, I take that lightly. I take all this lightly.\n\nWhat I want you to take seriously is what we have to do for the youth, because we coming up in a totally different world. This is not the same world that you had. This is not the 60s, this is not that. You grew up B.C.--before crack. That should say it all. We did not grow up with our parents. You had parents, that told you this and that and this is what went on back in the day. Now do you don\u2019t have that. You have young kids, fourteen, coming home and their mama\u2019s smoking out, or doing it to their best friend to get the product. You understand what I\u2019m saying?\n\nSo that means, it\u2019s not just about you taking care of your child; it\u2019s about you taking care of these children. It hurts that--no, it bothers me, not hurts--that I have to sidestep my youth to stand up and do some shit that somebody else supposed to be doing. It\u2019s too many men out here for me to be doing this. It ain\u2019t my turn yet. I\u2019m supposed to be following behind him, getting the knowledge. I don\u2019t even have a chance to get the fucking knowledge. I can\u2019t go to college; it\u2019s too much problems out here. I don\u2019t got the money, nobody do.\n\nSo what I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s not as easy as we mapping it out to be, and we gotta stay real. We gotta stay real. Before we can be new Africans, we gotta be black first. We gotta get our brothers from the street like Harriet Tubman did. Why can\u2019t we look at that and see exactly what she was doing. Like Malcolm did, the real Malcolm, before the Nation of Islam. You gotta remember: this was a pimp, a pusher and all that. We forgot about all that. In our striving to be enlightened, we forgot about all our brothers in the street, about all our dope dealers, our pushers and our pimps, and that\u2019s who\u2019s teaching the next generation. Because y\u2019all not doing it! I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s the pimps and the pushers who\u2019s teaching us. So if you\u2019ve got a problem with how we was raised, it\u2019s because they was the only ones who could do it. They the only ones who did it. While everybody else just wanted to go to college, and, you know, \u201ceverything has changed,\u201d they were the ones telling you, \u201cThe white man ain\u2019t shit. Here you go, check this out, young blood: You take this product, you switch it, you make money, and that\u2019s how you beat the white man. You get money, and you get the hell up outta here.\u201d Nobody else did that. So I don\u2019t want to hear shit about nobody telling me who I can\u2019t love and respect until you start doing what they did.\n\nTo me, this is Mecca. This is the black family--I see it here. But what makes it that much sadder, what makes me wanna cry is that, soon as I leave here, so does Mecca. We going back to the real deal. Right out there, you gonna see them same sisters in Brenda, they right out there. And y\u2019all gonna get in y\u2019all\u2019s cars and drive the fuck home. I apologize. I apologize, but check this out: you can\u2019t be no more offended by my cursing than what\u2019s really going on. That\u2019s real. That\u2019s real, y\u2019all. Because we letting the media--and the white man--turn us off. You letting them say that the rappers ain\u2019t real, and either gotta be the \u2018intelligent person\u2019 or you a \u2018gutter person.\u2019 We all the same. We all feel it like y\u2019all feel it.  I just can\u2019t hold a straight face when I see it.\n\nThis is proof that we can be together. The young black male is the future of us. And the young black sister is the future of us. It\u2019s gonna be what you put into it. So if you don\u2019t put shit into it, don\u2019t get mad when we blow up.", "year": null}, {"artist": "2Pac", "album": "Tupac: Resurrection OST", "title": "Starin' Through My Rear View", "lyrics": "[Intro: 2Pac]\nStarin' at the world through my rearview\nJust lookin' back at the world\nFrom another level, you know what I mean?

have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers\nBut for you there's only contempt\nThough you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly\nThis world could not accept your masterpieces,

out but ain't nobody lending hands\nCan you really blame them for trying to get what they can?\nLate night, bright lights, lust and lies\nAnd anything goes under the Hollywood sign\nWell you might lose your soul and who knows what you'll find\nBut go ahead man we all want to shine...\nBut go ahead man we all want to shine...\n\nCHORUS\n\n[Mac Mall]\nThere you have it..\nYou know, when I was

my music\nLike my homeboy 2Pac did for sure\nAnd he gave that to me\nBut he didn't, he didn't, he didn't let me know\nAbout all the shady shit that's in, in between\nYou and your dream, you know?\nSee

Nigel and Trevor took me to Nell's. When we got there, I was immediately impressed, because it was different than any club I'd been in. It wasn't crowded, there was lots of space, there were beautiful women there. I was meeting Ronnie Lott from the New York Jets and Derrick Coleman from the Nets. They were coming up to me, like, \"Pac, we're proud of you.\" I felt so tall that night, because they were people's heroes and they saying I was their hero. I felt above and beyond, like I was glowing.\n\nSomebody introduced me to this girl. And the only thing I noticed about her: She had a big chest. But she was not attractive; she looked dumpy, like. Money came to me and said, \"This girl wants to do more than meet you.\" I already knew what that meant: She wanted to fuck. I just left them and went to the dance floor by myself. They were playing some Jamaican music, and I'm just grooving.\n\nThen this girl came out and started dancing-and the shit that was weird, she didn't even come to me face-first, she came ass-first. So I'm dancing to this reggae music; you know how sensuous that is. She's touching my dick, she's touching my balls, she opened my zipper, she put her hands on me. There's a little dark part in Nell's, and I see people over there making out already, so she starts pushing me this way. I know what time it is.\n\nWe go over in the corner. She's touching me. I lift up my shirt while I'm dancing, showing off my tattoos and everything. She starts kissing my stomach, kissing my chest, licking me and shit. She's going down, and I'm, like, Oh shit. She pulled my dick out; she started sucking my dick on the dance floor. That shit turned me on. I wasn't thinking, like, This is going to be a rape case. I'm thinking, like, This is going to be a good night. You know what I'm saying?\n\nSoon as she finished that-just enough to get me solid, rock-hard-we got off the dance floor. I told Nigel, \"I've got to get out of here. I'm about to take her to the hotel. I'll see you all later.\" Nigel was, like, \"No, no, no. I'm going to take you back.\" We drive to the hotel. We go upstairs and have sex, real quick. As soon as I came, that was it. I was tired, I was drunk, I knew I had to get up early in the morning, so I was, like, \"What are you going to do? You can spend the night or you can leave.\" She left me her number, and everything was cool. Nigel was spending the night in my room all these nights. When he found out she sucked my dick on the floor and we had sex, he and Trevor were livid! Trevor is a big freak; he was going crazy. All he kept asking me was, \"D-d-did you fuck in the ass?\" He was listening to every single detail. I thought, This is just some guy shit, it's all good.\n\nWe had a show to do in New Jersey at Club 88. This dude said, \"I'll be there with a limo to pick you up at midnight.\" We went shopping, we got dressed up, we were all ready. Nigel was saying, \"Why don't you give her a call?\" So we were all sitting in the hotel, drinking. I'm waiting for the show, and Nigel's, like, \"I called her. I mean, she called me, and she's on her way.\" But I wasn't thinking about her no second time. We were watching TV when the phone rings, and she's downstairs. Nigel gave Man-man, my manager, some money to pay for the cab, and I was, like, \"Let that b*tch pay for her own cab.\" She came upstairs looking all nice, dressed all provocative and shit, like she was ready for a prom date.\n\nSo we're all sitting there talking, and she's making me uncomfortable, because instead of sitting with Nigel and them, she's sitting on the arm of my chair. And Nigel and Trevor are looking at her like a chicken, like she's, like, food. It's a real uncomfortable situation. So I'm thinking, Okay, I'm going to take her to the room and get a massage. I'm thinking about being with her that night at Nell's. So we get in the room, I'm laying on my stomach, she's massaging my back. I turn around. She starts massaging my front. This lasted for about a half an hour. In between, we would stop and kiss each other. I'm thinking she's about to give me another blow job. But before she could do that, some niggas came in, and I froze up more than she froze up. If she would have said anything, I would have said, \"Hold on, let me finish.\" But I can't say nothing, because she's not saying nothing. How do I look saying, \"Hold on\"? That would be like I'm making her my girl.\n\nSo they came and they started touching her a**. They going, \"Oooh, she's got a nice ass.\" Nigel isn't touching her, but I can hear his voice leading it, like, \"Put her panties down, put her pantyhose down.\" I just got up and walked out the room.\n\nWhen I went to the other suite, Man-man told me that Talibah, my publicist at the time, had been there for a while and was waiting in the bedroom of that suite. I went to see Talibah and we talked about what she had been doing during the day, then I went and laid down on the couch and went to sleep. When I woke up, Nigel was standing over me going, \"Pac, Pac,\" and all the lights was on in both rooms. The whole mood had changed, you know what I'm saying? I felt like I was drugged. I didn't know how much time had passed. So when I woke up, it was, like, \"You're going to the police, you're going to the police.\" Nigel walks out the room, comes back with the girl. Her clothes is on; ain't nothing tore. She just upset, crying hysterically. \"Why you let them do this to me?\" She's not making sense. \"I came to see you. You let them do this to me.\" I'm, like, \"I don't got time for this shit right here. You got to chill out with that shit. Stop yelling at me and looking at me all crazy.\" She said, \"This not the last time you're going to hear from me,\" and slammed the door. And Nigel goes, \"Don't worry about it, Pac, don't worry. I'll handle it. She just tripping.\" I asked him what happened, and he was, like, \"Too many niggas.\" You know, I ain't even tripping no more, you know? niggas start going downstairs, but nobody was coming back upstairs. I'm sitting upstairs smoking weed, like, Where the fuck is everybody at? Then I get a call from Talibah from the lobby saying, \"The police is down here.\"\n\n\nNever did nothing. Only thing I saw was all three of them in there and that nigga talking about how fat her ass was. I got up, because the nigga sounded sick. I don't know if she's with these niggas, or if she's mad at me for not protecting her. But I know I feel ashamed-because I wanted to be accepted and because I didn't want no harm done to me-I didn't say nothing.", "year": null}, {"artist": "2Pac", "album": null, "title": "The Realist Killaz", "lyrics": "Feat. 50 Cent\n\n[GUNSHOT]\nYo Redd Spyder (ooh-wee) is that 50 Cent/Pac joint ready?\n[gun cocking] Let me know, holla\n\n[2Pac - from the song \"Smile\"]\nThere's gon' be some stuff you gon' see\nThat's gon' make it hard to smile in the future\n\n[50 Cent]\nYeah nigga!

in your eyes\nThought I'd never feel this way again\nAnd you were supposed to reach my heart\nAnd find love within, love, love\n\nLove within a storm (x4)\nThis sweet, wonderful ghetto love\nThis sweet, wonderful love that you give me\nWonderful\n\nI could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near\nAny problems plaguing my mind, would suddenly dissapear\nIt was rebirth of my heart, the day that you became my friend\nBecause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again\nFall in love again, in a storm\n\nLove within a storm\n\nJust when I thought I'd seen it all\nOur paths crossed, amen\nAnd I knew, from the first glance\nThat you, would be hard to forget\nYour eyes, attracted me first\nBut you reeked of sultry confidence\nI couldn't wait, to touch lips\nAnd kiss, with my heart's intention\nWhen we did it, was what I expected\nAnd for that moment, we erased the tension\nOf the awkwardness, of first date jitters\nAnd the initial blind date, first impressions\nWe kissed again; and I felt the passion\nAnd this, my love, was Cupid's blessing\n\nWe made love, within a storm\nIn the midst of passion and chaos\nSomewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost\nIn the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder\nThose who prevail this drama\nWill learn to bring their love farther\nBut now, the storm has past\nAnd the seas of our friendship are gone\nBut as long as I live, I will remember\nThe love within a storm\n\nSweet, passionate, love-lusting love\nYou know that I miss you, and love you\nYou know that 2Pac broke my heart\nWe need to hear ya, hear ya voice\nThey say, this ghetto fabulous\nOn 125th street forkin' around\nThis village, and the village uptown\nSouth Central, Compton, Philly\nChi-Town,

And I'm talking to Al Sharpton about this, some other motherfuckers with some power. And then when we do that, we register to the voters, and if we can register for Democrats, Republican or independent. Once we register to the voters, we have power. Then we start going up to the mayors of these cities and telling them, \"Look, we got this many voters in this city; we want you to do this we want a community center.\" We start hittin' up Nike for the free clothes and [?] stores for the free computers in each community center.

We invite those niggas to dinner, invite them niggas to some Dom P\u00e9rignon.\n[*Sanyika laughs*]\nT: And lobster, anjd be like look player we askin' you not tellin' you, we askin' you as a player to a player, can you please give us a path to have these street clean, from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. Let that be for the kids, let them niggas be safe, doing no time, no gun shots, no drug dealings from 11 p.m. till 6 a.m. y'all can have the streets back, but let us get the streets from these times then we can get these [?] he said he can get to the the police to like chill out um no those nights times patrol, if niggas can get the streets clean from 6 to 11.\nS: Hey but you know what else too though?

I heard they wanted you to compensate them.\nT: They trying to sue me!\nS: Word!\nT: These fools shot at me!\nS: And you defended yourself.\nT: And they trying to sue me [2Pac laughing]. And white people is crazy, 'cause if it was anybody else they get that nigga a ticket to their parade\nS: Straight up.\nT: Unarmed man, two motherfuckers. I was fucked up. They suing me, I got this girl who lied about the rape shit.\nS: You smoke weed right now?\nT: huh?\nS: You smoking weed right now.\nT: Nah cigarette, I will be smoking some weed. My homeboy is in Colombia right now\nS: Yeah.\nT: But um the girl. See the girl that did this rape shit, she hooked up with the niggas that shot me.\nS: Oh, is that right?\nT: They all connected. It was a big plan, I just caught it like at the end. And that's why they shot me.\nS: Man! Hey man, you gotta stay up man. When you step through that, that way you gotta be on point.\nT: I ain't goin' through there no more, if I do, I'm going with hundred motherfuckers.\nS: And I'll be one of them.\nT: Yup, no doubt.\nS: No dizoubt. We can't be having you not here you know what I'm saying\nT: I know that's what they told me but you know what, you know what it was?\nHere's my problem just like I'm telling you what she saying, I always 'cause I'm where my mom ama raised me the way I'm moving in, they fucked my head in a way, see like you, you could be movement oriented but you got the gang bang shit first in your mind.\nS: Right, right\nT: My shit the gang bang shit come second to me\nS: Right, right\nT: And now I'm trying to make it come first 'cause that movement shit will fuck you up. Movement shit got me loving every brother\nS: Yeah! at that point you know I gotta get next to you [?]\nT: Right, to me I'm there for you, nigga need money and job I'm wit' you, niggas come to me with guns on, niggas hugging me with TECs on, you know what I mean?\nS: It just though. you know what the thing is man, we gotta be individuals too inside the movement and wherever we involved in right? We gotta be able to differentiate between cats that are firm and cats that's ain't firm, sometimes it take sometimes but test. We talk about friends that's mean, you know. I am who I am, I survived through what I survived through by being intelligent, by not allowing cats to outsmart me and putting me in precarious positions where I can get whacked, right?\nTrying to choose my friends very very carefully and I over said there's layers and layers of friends, you see. Some I hold close to the body, man, like a vest and others hold at arm's distance, some just look at, some I don't even fuck with, but the circles is small but the ones that are in there I believe are trustworthy right. For instance, you and I. You and I have been probably through the same shit in our lives\n\nT: No doubt.\n\nS: You know what I'm saying? and we're like 10 years apart, almost. So it's like almost a common destiny. What you grew up then is where I came around too. You see what I'm saying? The banging shit was first with me and then the movement. Wit' you the movement was first and then the banging was came second.\n\nT: Yes that's the ill shit.\nS: I'm getting around to where you grew up at\nT: And I'm getting around the way you grew up at.\nS:  You see so, so who else better, you see, who can get along like you and I?\n\nT: No doubt.\n\nS: Watching else's back\nT: No doubt\n\nS: 'Cause you want it, I want it, but together you know I mean. Man you got the courage of the godfather\nwhen the shit-- what happened when [?] wrote that piece [?] dealing with the pigs right, I was like that was my boy man\n\nT: No doubt! You see that's another problem I'm helping another nigga, nigga I don't even know, nigga in the middle of the streets, he run off and don't even help me.\n\nS: Yeah, that fucked up man!\n\nT: These niggas that shot me like wanna see that when a white trash put a gun on me I can prepared. You know what I mean? I can react. When a nigga pull a gun on me I'm like \"froze up\" I'm like \"oh shit a nigga gon kill me?\"\n\nS: You know what we should do, Pac? I'm telling you, me and you should sit down, right, and we should do a book on you, man.\n\nT: Yeah? How you gon' do that?\n\nS: You know what I'm talking about, I'm talking about, a straight up autobiography or something like that based on your life like Malcolm X [?] out with Alex Haley. I'm telling you, man. 'Cause the shit that you been through and I been through, just like my book man, I had to document that shit\n\nT: Hey, your book is I swear on everything homie, I'm not just saying this shit, your shit is a classic, yo when I was up in that jailhouse nigga who hated west side they don't like nothing, they loving you. I had those motherfuckers speechless, they was reading, niggas that can't read was reading your shit in one day, nobody can put that shit down.\n\nS: but yours just as explosive and I'm telling you, brother, I guarantee you before even get through it as a book Hollywood will be on our jock\n\nT: They already want me to be something, poppin' hoes in the back 'cause I can't get the right one, I asked like Maya Angelou to help me write autobiography, she was like \"okay\"\n\nS: You know what you need, somebody to write it from our level to kick the slang and the shit right. Maya Angelou might put some perfect English in that motherfucker.\n\nT: And then it ain't come out right.\nS: you and I we gon' kick the language we kick.\nT: figures like I be your shit\nS: I'm telling you.\nT: But you know where you gotta pull me into?\nS: What?\nT: Overstand.\nS: I'm telling you.\nT: Pull me here into overstand man\nS: dig it, this is the thing.\n\nT: lil do it one time and I ain't [?]\n\nS: okay dig it. The word \"understand\" is to play on one's person, right for instance, understand, to stand under, to be below, to be demeaned, and so. When you're under anything it's hard for you to get a whole view to of what's going on above-ground. So when you're under you have a disadvantage. So especially when you're standing on someone or under anything you can't comprehend it, you can't feel it, you can't vibe wit' it. So I created the word \"over-stand\" to get up over that shit, to get a vantage point, even looking down on some shit, you see what I'm sayin'. Like a helicopter got a vantage point over us when we have to get in the streets and break. They can see us better than a pig at our level\n\nT: So like that!\n\nS: The helicopter has an overstanding on us to great degree, you see what I'm saying, we have to do, words control people man I'm telling you. When you think.. when you speak positive, you think positive. So all the time I be trying to overstand shit, get a full comprehension\n\nT: that's right!\n\nS: you feel me? Yeah, that's where I came from, that concept came..\n\nT: That's right. Had you on that shit man\n\nS: They made me like pops, they made me like pops\n\n[Tupac's laughs]\n\nS: I'm telling you me and pops was like, 'cause when I had Mutulu million right, we were getting our court spot on, and he sending me the thugs code, of course I endorsed it right. Then, next thing I know, I got a clipping [prisoners of war] so we had to do whole another trip with the mayor, alright. And then I heard [?] has drowned.\n\nT: Yeah he aight now.\n\nS: [?] He's respiratory\n\nT: I'm in jail too they telling me that shit. But shit that's fucked up was like me and him used to talk all the time. When I first came to LA he was like my eyes and ears I told him everything. [?] that they he was like we was talking every day and they just killed that shit. I haven't talked to him in like a year. More than that\n\nS: But still they know you got legacy movement problems with the pigs, they stand to see you brother 'cause end up in the bloodline\n\nT: You ain't lying. [?] calling me hold up one more time\n...\n\nT: Hello\n\nS: Yeah\n\nT: But, man [?] shit that I couldn't even read your shit like how you been saying when hit the nigga in nuts and all that shit\n\nS: Yeah\n\nT: you ain't lying, I get up these motherfuckers calling me nigger, and I'm buggin out, I never had white people calling me nigger and nothing happened. And [?] you get 7 years if you touched the police no matter what, 7 years no matter what, 'cause I was in maximum security in Dannemora then they had me in a special program like a federal program they got called APPU - Advance Placement something something something - where all like notorious motherfuckers. I'm hopping in there niggas with 80\u00ad. Damn, one more time...\n\nS: Alright\n\nT: Hello. I'm up in there with niggas with 80 years and 60 years and I'm doing one and a half to four and a half. And I'm knowing my life in danger. These niggas ain't never getting out.\n\nS: Yeah I've seen moms on [?] she was [?] that right? That she had you in a maximum security prison.\n\nT: Yup! locked down 23 hours a day\n\nS: that's how you had me\n\nT: Before I even broke the rules\n\nS: And that's heavy. And you didn't even get an opportunity to break one.\n\nT: And he was like for my own protection 'cause I wouldn't find it [?] but they got mad right, cause they was telling me that you goin to die in here and you gon die in here, I said why am just have to die here, I'm not starting no PC. He like they put you in IPC-- that's Involuntary Protective Custody.\n\nS: right right\n\nT: so I'm fighting I'm getting lawyers to fight me to get out of there to get me in population, cause they put me in population the first day I got there, right.\n\nS: Was it true?\n\nT: Hell yeah! Even though I'm on the other side I'm with all enemies. These niggas hating 'cause I'm banging on east coast, screaming, \"West side, west side\" any team everything. So when I get there\nthe pigs they ain't get me no toilet sheets, you know you come there you get that cock shit, it was bloody cot, no nothing\nhe left me in population for like two hours, in two hours I had everything I needed, niggas gave me two stakes, two\nniggas bringing knives, weed, heroin, cocaine everything I wanted, I was like \"nah I'm cool homie I don't need that\" I gave the niggas their bangers back, I didn't want no bangers, they want to stab me up for nothing, it was three murders while I was there\n\nS: Damn [?]\n\nT: they got the highest level of murders in New Work state. You can get murdered man, niggas with the same pow line know what's happen\n\nS: Dannemora huh?\nT: yep they crazy up there\nS: it was proper\nT: they crazy up there, riot\nS: They been hooking you up on the video\nT: Yeah no doubt I wanted to keep my face out there\nS: you shot that shit\n\nT: we finna gon shoot another video me and Dre finna do the shit called California love with Roger\n\nS: oh okay\nT: it's gon be the bomb mayne, peep it up for California mayne\nS: I be glad to see you back out there\n\nT: I got to take it all back, I won't be happy till I do it, they gotta be sorry for what they did.\n\nS: I'm telling you, hey I'm wit you man\n\nT: got to\n\nS: Check this out I wanna come down and chill wit you\n\nT: come on man what's sup. I be having Operations From the Bottom\n\nS: yup\n\nT: they be in there with me kicking it\n\nS: yeah I like them I give shoutout for them\nbut I'm telling you some lyrics man\n\nT: Come on you come with some lyrics you can spit on any song I got\n\nS: I got some shit I'm telling you\n\nT: I'm in the studio today I'm in the studio every day\nS: Okay, what about Friday\nT: friday I be there, that's when Sista Soulja coming through\nS: Okay I'ma call you, what time you free to be going?\nT: One o'clock\nS: I'ma call you man\nT: alright, I be there man\nS: I love you man\nT: One love\nS: Watch yourself brother\nT: no doubt\nS: I hate to come [?] and tear shit for you\nT: nah nah\nS: I'm telling [?]\nT: aight man *laughs* contact me man\nS: I will\nT: Alright", "year": "1995-10-18"}, {"artist": "2Pac", "album": null, "title": "Tupac: Resurrection; THUG LIFE", "lyrics": "When I'm saying Thug, I mean not criminals; someone who beats you up and that\nI mean the underdog, the person that nothing succeeds; he's a thug, because\nHe overcome all obstacles, it doesn't have anything to do with the dictionaries\nVersion of thug, for me thug is my pride, not being someone who goes against the law\nNot being someone to take, but being someone who has nothing, and that he don't have nothing\nAnd there's no home for him to go to, my head is up high, my chest is out, I walk tall, I talk loud\n\nI'm being strong!\n\nI don\u2019t understand why America doesn\u2019t understand Thug Life.

It is my wish that when this letter reaches you it finds you and your family in safety and serenity. Now, where do I start? I'm sitting here with a fat stack of letters and through them all I immediately recognize your handwriting and know that you finally written me back and as usual it was worth the wait. This letter is hard to write because I'm editing as I write. I'm preoccupied with having any of my statements misjudged as \"hustling\"! :) First of all, let me answer your questions. #1. No, I don't mind long letters in fact I wish yours were longer and yes I would love to not only hear of your adventures but also share some of my own. Yes, I will write a book. Right now I'm writing 3 screenplays so upon my release I can recoup from my losses. Instead of complaining about bad movie roles or negative stereotypes I'm writing my own visions. As far as the book is concerned, I am working on doing an Autobiography but if it is at all possible I want us to do a book together. That would truly be the \"BOMB\"! Let me just tell you ever since I've read your book it has been going from person to person like a bible. Everybody from male inmates to female inmates have been reading it. I get a sense of pride at being the person to turn them on to your literary talents. Plus, I use your book with the women in my life. I have asked two females to read it and we use each chapter as a door to our own lives. Like the chapter on Nikki is my favorite. I was trying over the past few months to this female in my life why it was so hard 4 me 2 trust her regardless of how sweet and innocent she portrayed herself to be and only after reading that chapter did she finally understand. This is some personal shit but I feel as though I can trust you so.... Okay there's that chapter where you were contemplating sharing this man with another woman. I'm in that position now. I love one woman (A) because she's dependable, loving, supportive, and she's young and open to me guiding her through this crazy life (Who am I 2 guide?) Anyway woman \"A\" is from the streets and that's all she knows but I can see and feel how much she loves me. Woman \"B\" on the other hand is famous, rich, and able to assist me financially, loving, and very sexual. She's known me since before I got into the business and she's been there from the jump. However, she's bisexual and so into her career that we don't have much time together. So I'm literally torn between an old friend who went from being of a platonic nature to a potential wife and a new friend who has been there through the whole gunshot/rape/near death experience. I have rejected them both but then reconsidered and got 'em both back. They know of the other and I have tried to make it work as a threesome. Not sexually but commitment wise. Had I not read your book I would have continued living and juggling with all of these other women but between them both I completely satisfied. I've always felt that when I love someone it is so intense that I drive them away but with \"A\" and \"B\" it evens everything out. I can satisfy both of them and not because I'm a \"Supermanlove\" but because I truly love them both and the intensity and passion I feel for them keeps me driven to please them. Can u feel me? It's hard to explain on paper maybe when you visit me I can elaborate which brings me to my next step. Yes I would love 4 u 2 come visit me there isn't a list but there are certain days and times for each inmate. I'll attempt to reach you by phone to make it happen. Now back to me controlling my sexual desires. Now be honest, as a woman, how could you love a man that couldn't satisfy you? Since men are born totally inept sexually we only learn how 2 please a woman from pleasing a woman. So as rotten as it seems practice makes perfect. Every woman I have been with has not only taken what I learned from the last woman but taught me and prepared me for the next and since I am not married and yet to find the perfect woman you described I am forever in search of her. I have been with many married women from wives of powerful drug lords to the wives of broke everyday Joes to the wives of quite a few very famous and rich singers/actors and seeing their wives hungry for someone else has shown me that only by being able to completely satisfy a woman in every way, shape, and form can I truly find a happy and trusting faithful relationship. Now to answer your other questions. My health is fine I truly feel blessed that other than mentally I have no scars or lasting problems from my \"ordeal\". I still have the complete use of every nerve, limb, and muscle and more surprisingly I can still make love and have babies after taking a shot to my scrotum! Talk about faith in God! :)! Mentally however the helpless feeling never leaves me. I can't sleep! I wake up sweaty and disorientated when I do doze off and I will never erase the faces of my attackers from my mind. 2 be honest the bullets didn't hurt much not at first but afterwards it was painful. I didn't feel the shots in my head, hand, scrotum but because of all the muscles involved the leg wound was a real bitch! I don't really have any gun phobias meaning if it happened again I would react the same way. The pain came as I lay in the hospital thinking about the fact that some \"Thug\" brothers shot me. Then to hear I was found guilty of something I had not done plus wondering if my family was safe SCARED ME! Even with 5 gunshot wounds my paranoid ass was still sleeping with a 12 gauge and a Glock. I never planned to turn myself in I planned on shooting it out but upon further reflection I realized I owed alot to my people. Although I would have been at peace, the misery of our folks would continue.

motherfucker still love you, still feel you\nStill there for you, no matter what (hehe)\nYou will always be in my heart with unconditional love\n\n[Verse 1]\nCome listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings\nAll my peers doin' years beyond drug dealing\nHow many caskets can we witness\nBefore we see it's hard to live this life without God?\nSo we must ask forgiveness\nAsk Mama why I got this urge to die\nWitness the tears fallin' free from my eyes before she could reply\nThough we were born without a silver spoon\nMy broken down TV show cartoons in my living room (hey)\nOne day I hope to make it, a player in this game\nMama, don't cry, long as we try maybe things change\nPerhaps it's just a fantasy\nA life where we don\u2019t need no welfare and share with our whole family\nMaybe it's me that caused it, the fightin' and the hurtin'\nIn my room cryin' because I didn't wanna be a burden\nWatch Mama open up her arms to hug me\nAnd I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, with unconditional love\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see\nThough things change, the future's still inside of me\nWe must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark\nSo you

the dark\nSo you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love\n\n[Verse 2]\nJust got the message, you've been callin' all week\nBeen out here hustlin' on these streets\nAin't had a chance to speak\nBut you know, with you and me it's all G\nWe could never be enemies\n'Cause you've been such a good friend to me\nWhere would I be without my dogs?\nNo wonder why when times get hard\n'Cause it ain't easy bein' who we are\nDriven by my ambitions, desire higher positions\nSo I proceed to make G's eternally\nAnd my mission is to be more than just a rap musician\nThe elevation of today's generation, if I could make 'em listen\nPrison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed\nTime to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat\nWe work somethin' out of nothin'\nNo pleasure in the sufferin'\nNeighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin'\nThe liquor and the weed, the cussin'\nSendin' love out to my block\nThe struggle never stops (unconditional love)\n\n[Chorus]\nIn this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see\nThough things change, the future's still inside of me\nWe must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark\nSo you will always be in

a star\nMy hopes and all my wishes, so many vivid pictures\nAnd all the currency I'll never even get to see\nThis fast life soon shatters, 'cause after all the lights and screams nothin' but my dreams matter\nHopin' for better days, maybe a peaceful night\nBaby, don't cry, 'cause everything gon' be alright\nJust lay your head on my shoulder\nDon't worry 'bout a thing, baby girl, I'm a soldier (huh)\nNever treated me bad, no matter who I was\nYou still came with that unconditional love\n\n[Chorus] (repeat to fade)\nIn this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see\nThough things change, the
