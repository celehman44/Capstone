game\nIf they try to retreat, I catch'em one at a time\nCoz they're comittin a crime, and still promotin a rhyme\nSo, you in the back of me just listen and learn\nBecause you'll all get a chance or maybe a turn\nNow my assignment was to give a preview\nSo at my next concert I wanna see you there\nNot sittin in a chair standin on both feet, with yo hand in the air\nNow I'm about to jet out but I'll be back\nBut next time expect a more funkier track\nDeep down for your enjoyment to hear more percussion\nWith lyrics that's smooth to start some discussion\nThe prove that I'm hype and you know
