off\nWinning and losing\nGood and great\nBetween great and the best\n\nFocusing could be the most self-fulfilling thing you could do for yourself because with focus comes accomplishment\nFocusing could bring out your greatest talents and give you true purpose in this world\nIt can take your natural ability and magnify it to extraordinary\nOne thing I learned and I'm sure most of us know is what you focus on\nWhat you put your energy into\nIs exactly what we should expect back\nThat's just the law of the universe\n\nKarma\nI seen it happen like 10,000 times\nIt is proven that 1+1 being two\n\nFocus is the key to being successful in any situation\nIf you focus on the wrong, you'll get the wrong things\nThere's no way to focus on one thing and expect something different\nHow you focus on something is giving attention to it\nEven if you don't like it and still focus on not liking it, you're still putting your attention to it and will still attract it\n\nFor example, if you focus on wanting a new car, you'll keep attracting the idea of wanting a new car\nBut it is easy to confuse that, because wanting a new car isn't the way to manifest it\nYou're simply just wanting a new car and not obtaining a new car\nRemember, the intent of your focus is so important\nThere's a difference between focusing on wanting a new car and focusing on a car being yours\nWe really should be clear on what we focus on\n\nHonestly, I feel like time is the most valuable thing we have ever been given and focus runs parallel to that\nBecause every second of the day we're focused on something, whether you realize it or not\nI for sure am a victim of focusing on the wrong things sometimes\nI spent a little too much time on my phone looking at comments, focusing on how it'd feel a little too long\nBut that's just human\n\nIt's very rare that you'd probably focus on 100% of your time on what you need to\nBut the biggest advantage is to quickly catch yourself and be able to reset your focus\nFor me, there's no way I could focus on something I don't love\nAt least not for long\n\nI'm just not content with my spending my life miserable and I just personally can't live like that\nIt is not a party of vibration you could tell how you feel\nYour inner guidance system\nYour feelings\nIf I feel good, I'm doing the right thing\nIf not then it's not what I'm supposed to be doing\n\nHow does what you focus on makes you feel?\nRemember, it's never too late or too early to know what makes you happy and to make that change by any means necessary\nI went into my last album focused\nI wanted to focus on making music that would change people's lives, help lift their moods up\nMusic that I felt that was undeniably great to me and talk about what directly affected me\nAnd that's what I did\nI never focused so much on executing these things while making music and what'd you know?\nMy first number one album and my most successful one yet\n\nYou can't measure success by anything but happiness\nI say that all the time\nAnd if you focus your energy on what makes you happy\nWhat do you think will happen?\nExactly\nIt always work out\n\nRewire any thoughts you had prior and know that you are what you focus on\n\nFocus", "year": "2015-07-01"}, {"artist": "Big Sean", "album": null, "title": "Forever Reppin", "lyrics": "Lets do it\n\nAnd Im good\n\nYou keep countin' that money, I'mma

that\nThere are certain things you can control\nSome you can't\nWhen you approach a situation with patience\nYou bring your best self to that situation\nGiving yourself the best chance at success\nAt whatever is at hand\nI learn there are lessons in patience\nIt could teach us a lot of things\nI could give you a hundred stories\nAbout how I wish I could go back in time to talk to myself -\nTell me to calm down, relax, don't let this throw you off\nWhen I graduated highschool I decided to focus on music\nIt was one of the hardest things to watch all my homies at school\nEspecially the schools I could have went to\nI felt like everyone around me was progressing\nAnd I was at a standstill\nMan I was doing a lot of reading\nI realize you have to recognize your own process\nAnd it can't be measured by anything but happiness\nJust remember your journey is the most important part of the story\nNot the trophy\nThe time I spent frustrated, depressed\nAfraid of what might happen or not happen\nWas the worst things I ever went through\nWorst feelings I ever felt\nI didn't get anywhere thinking, feeling like that\nIt was when I came out of that way of thinking that it all started

I'm headed to paradise one way\nThis feel like the family dinners that we used to have on Sunday\nWith Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake\nOr this spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man\nThis feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam\nPink Timb's, in the Lamb\nMixing it in with Dilla and\nHeadphones to the ceiling fan\nBucket hat like Gilligan, yeah\nLately I've been talking to ghosts\nDidn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most\nYou know I still rep you when you're gone though\nI got a picture of us on the front lawn\nWith me, grandma and mom, that night I went off to prom\nWishin' you could see the lights all dijon and parmesan\nFunny thing about it is you always act like you knew\nYou told me how you were feeling before it happened, before it do\nAnd you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through\nAnd you and grandma went broke so we would never get bruised\nYou the reason that I ever touched my first Franklin\nFast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin\nIt reminded me of how we always used to dress up as a family\nAnd go to Sunday service, and being in church singin'\nAin't been to church in awhile\nBut it ain't just about how you just praise him in the building\nIt's about how you praisin' him while you out\nYou taught me to remember that when I get set back\nBeen through the worst times to get the best back\nWishin' for a time machine to jet back\nTo my all time low self and throw me a jetpack, woah\nAnd see you again, needless to say\nBack when I dated Alisha, Simone\nOr any other girl who looked like Lisa Bonet\nWho was jealous of me and Jhen\u00e9\nWho you would always advise with me being away\nYou was right, but I had to learn for myself\nI guess a time came for me to earn for myself\nI hope that this is somewhat of a thank you for all your help\nHope the angels take care of you until I see you myself\n\n[Bridge: The-Dream]\nPraise, so many times I prayed for you\nI put up prayers for you\nPraise, for all the times that you prayed for me\nAll the nights you stayed by me\nAll the nights that you cried and all the days I coulda died\nBecause of you I survived, because of you I'm still alive\n\n[Hook: Big Sean]\nThank you God for all my set backs\n'Cause he the reason I'm able to get back\nThis feels like my Sunday morning jetpack\nFeel like I sent the prayers up and got

times, we smoke, tree times\nWe climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time\nThe cancer done came, it just hit it's prime\nIt came from the breast, just spread to the spine\nIt might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:\n\"This can't be my mom!\"\nGot me thinking, \"whats a girl to do, a girl to do?\nWhen her world's a pool?\nAnd she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames\nAnd all
