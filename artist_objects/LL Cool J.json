her hair\nBamboo earrings, at least two pair\nA Fendi bag and a bad attitude\nThat's all I need to get me in a good mood\nShe can walk with a switch and talk with street slang\nI love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thing\nStanding at the bus stop, sucking on a lollipop\nOnce she gets pumping, its hard to make the hottie stop\nShe likes to dance to the rap jam\nShe sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams\nHoney coated complexion, using Camay\nLets hear it for the girl she's from around the way\n\nCHORUS:\nI need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)\nThat's the one for

dedicate at least one rhyme\nTo all the cuties in the neighborhood\n'Cause if I didn't tell you, then another brother would\nYour sweet like sugar with your gangsta talk\nWant to eat you like a cookie when I see you walk\nWith your rayon, silk, or maybe even denim\nIt really doesn't matter as long as you're in 'em\nYou can break hearts and manipulate minds\nOr surrender, act tender, be gentle and kind\nYou always know what to say and do\nCold flip when you think your man is playing you\nNot cheap or petty , you're ready for lovin'\nYou're real independent so your parents be buggin'\nBut if you ever need a place to stay\n(Oooh you love me) come around my way\n\nCHORUS:\nI need an around-the-way girl (around-the-way girl)\nThat's the one for me\nShe's the only one for me\nTo the bridge\nI

there ain't no room for a spare\nBig beats bumpin with the bass in back\nAll the sophisticated suckers catch a heart attack\nCos they don't understand why I act this way\nPumpin up the funky beat

frequently\nThey tell me don't drink and drive, I say what is this\nMind your business\nNow pass it around\nLaid back, hypnotized by the funky sound\nPeople in the street see me bobbin my head\nWhile I'm checkin out the rapper and the rhyme that he said\nI'm frontin, and I don't care if you know\nThe backseat of my car is like a disco show\nYou would think I was a good friend of Al Capone\nCrazy air freshener, who needs cologne\nBottom to the bottom to the top to the top\nCruise - it's 3 o'clock\nThe girlies, they smile, they see me comin\nI'm steady hummin, I got the Funky Drummer drummin\nMy trunk be shakin, vibratin and rattlin\nPumpin so loud, all the shorties be battlin\nA right-hand man's here without the swing\nEvery chance I get I'm showin off my rings\nI can keep it up until the break of dawn\nCos I'm frontin in my ride and my word is bond\n\nSun roof open, so I can feel the wind blow\nI don't give a damn if it cracks my back window\nC to the o to the o to the l to

cosy\nI got the gangster tapes in the place\nLike a basehead would say: I want bass\nI want a hit, I want a dose\nYou're rollin up smilin, but you can't come close\nCos my system is pumpin loud\nLike Rakim said: I wanna move the crowd\nI warm it up with Kane, fight the power with PE\nTell the cops: you gots to chill with EPMD\nThis is something devastatin that'll break your trunk\nAnd remember,
