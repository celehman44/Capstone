I want to say some \"thank you\"s really quick. Thank God for Stephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn't care about what Ghost somebody's driving or how big somebody's house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So, make some noise for Stephen Hill to start this\n\nSo, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, I'm pretty sure he's not gonna start the music on me. If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, \"You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude.\" But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain't got nothing to do with the money\n\nAnd it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote \"Nigga lover\" because Robert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off. She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, \"Dad why you going so crazy?\" He said to her, \"One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And it's gonna be hard, you're gonna see how hard it is.\"\n\nSo, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why I'm not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people's perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea\n\nHarriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and I'm sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren't free. So don't think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we're free. And don't think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we're free. And don't think that because it's 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we're free. It's the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being cool\n\nI thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves. Our power, our oil, since we don't own any oil. Our oil is our expression, is our influence. Don't never let them take that away.

If you feel like you're seeing people dying right next to you, you might feel like what's the point? You know, like, life could be, like, start to feel worthless in a way. I know times for me, I sit down and talk to older, rich people, you know -- aka white -- and uh, they tell me, \"Don't compare yourself to Steve Jobs, don't compare yourself to Walt Disney.\" And my friend Sekaya told me -- ayy, bruh, bruh!\n\nThey tell me, \"Don't compare yourself to these people,\" right? My friend Sekaya told me it's three keys to keeping people impoverished: taking away their esteem, taking away their resources, and taking away their role models. My role models are Artists Merchants. It's less than 10 I can name in history. Truman, Ford, Hughes, Disney, Jobs, West\n\n(Audience cheer) Bro! Broooo!\n\nTonight, we're here to have fun.

majored in don't make no money\nBut she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny\nNow, tell me that ain't insecurr\nThe concept of school seems so securr\nSophmore three yurrs ain't picked a carurr\nShe like fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair\nCause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs\nCause her baby daddy don't really care\nShe's so precious with the peer pressure\nCouldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis\nShe had hair so long that it looked like weave\nThen she cut it all off now she look like Eve\nAnd she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe\nSingle black female addicted to retail and well\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nOh when it all, it all falls down\nUh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?\nOh when it all, it all falls down\nC'mon c'mon, and when it falls down\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nMan I promise, I'm so self-conscious\nThat's why you always see me with at least one of my watches\nRollies and Pashas done drove me crazy\nI can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!\nThen I spent 400 bucks on this\nJust to be like, \"Nigga, you ain't up on this!\"\nAnd I can't even go to the grocery store\nWithout some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team\nIt seems we living the American Dream\nBut the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem\nThe prettiest people do the ugliest things\nFor the road to riches and diamond rings\nWe shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us\nWe trying to buy back our 40 acres\nAnd for that paper, look how low we a stoop\nEven if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nOh when it all, it all falls down\nUh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?\nOh when it all, it all falls down\nC'mon

really need 'em\nThings we buy to cover up what's inside\nCause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth\nThat's why shorties holler, \"Where the ballers at?\"\nDrug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack\nAnd the white man get paid off of all of that\nBut I ain't even gonna act holier than thou\nCause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou\nBefore I had a house and I'd do it again\nCause I wanna be on 106 & Park pushing a Benz\nI wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific\nI got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific\nI got a problem with spending before I get it\nWe all self-conscious I'm just the first to admit it\n\n[Chorus: Kanye West]\nOh when it all, it all falls down\nUh, and when it falls down who you gon' call now?\nOh when it all, it all falls down\nC'mon c'mon, and when it falls down\n\nDon't stop that shit, keep that shit\nKeep that part where I ran out of breath\nWe ain't doing no punch-ins, man\nThat's that fake shit\nIf I was on stage, how I gotta spit it?\nIt's from the heart anyway\nMight cause shortness of breath, ya know?\nCouldn't have got nobody better for the job\nThank you very much this a beautiful\nBeautiful young lady that's inspired

VMA Performance 2013", "lyrics": "Http://www.schaulager.org/smq/files/lynching_tree.jpg\n\nThis performance features a clear example of using symbolism to enrich the message of the song\n\nBlood on the Leaves tells the story of a relationship torn apart by materialism, unprotected sex, and drugs. West samples Nina Simone's rendition of 'Strange Fruit', a song that paints a vivid picture of racial violence in the segregated South. West samples the line: \"Black bodies swinging from the summer breeze; strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.\" The frenzied, pitched up use of this line cast the song in a racial light. The characters in 'Blood on the Leaves' become the lynched victims in 'Strange Fruit'. Instead of racial violence, these characters have fallen victim to the perils of materialism, drugs and unprotected sex, all of which are issues that disproportionately affect the black community\n\nWest performed this song,already saturated with meaning, at the VMA awards in front of a purposefully lighted and positioned backdrop of a photo by film director Steven McQueen. The photo depicts a tree in New Orleans that was the site of racially charged lynchings. It\u2019s lit and positioned in such a way that as West performs in front of it, he appears as a shadow, his erratic movements almost resembling a man hanging from the branches. The shadows of the audience\u2019s raised hands appear at the bottom of the frame, as if coming out of the ground, representing the scores of victims buried at sites like this across America\n\nHttp://divaartist.com/divablog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screenshot_2013-08-26-00-20-13_1.jpg\n\nAfter the performance West posted a picture of the tree captioned: \"those who were murdered are buried in the ground around the tree.\"\n\nHttps://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1377548967_JKYK1ZZ.jpg\n\nThis nuanced imagery, rife with symbolism, paints a powerful and disturbing scene

while some people can shift the consciousness. often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends.\n\nApril 17th, 2018\n\nAs a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency. You have to protect your ability to create at all cost. try to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas.\n\ndistraction is the enemy of vision. Sometimes you have to get rid of everything.\n\neverything you do in life stems from either fear or love. Fear often causes people to be manipulative. be transparent as possible. Stop setting plays. Stop playing chess with life. Make decisions based on love not fear.\n\ntrend is always late\n\nApril 18th, 2018\n\nwhen you first wake up don't hop right on the phone or the internet or even speak to anyone for even up to an hour if possible. Just be still and enjoy your own imagination. It's better than any movie.\n\nYou have the best ideas. Other people's opinions are usually more  distractive than informative. Follow your own vision. base your actions on love. Do things you love and if you don't absolutely love something stop doing it as soon as you can. Don't follow crowds. Follow the innate feelings inside of you. Do what you feel not what you think. Thoughts have been placed in our heads to make everyone assimilate. Follow what you feel.\n\nI don't believe in the concept of an enemy. We have been conditioned to always be in competition. Stop looking for something to beat and just be. You don't have to do all the work. Once you start moving in love the universe will assist you. You will be a drop of water with the ocean as your army. If you move out of fear than your on your own. Then it's just you and the money and the countless people you have to lie to and manipulate to build a man made path that will never lead to true happiness. just stop lying about shit. Just stop lying.\n\nin life, we are all trained actors. When we're born we're ourselves and then one of the first things we're thought is how to act.  If you see a kid screaming at a restaurant because he feels something and can't express himself in a conventional manner. everyone will say he needs to learn how to act. At home parental acting classes are one of the first steps to us loosing who we really are to \"the simulation\".  Parents are our first acting coaches.\n\nme and my friend Anthony Schiller always ask questions about time. Is time linear? I recently did an interview where I placed a high value on time. Everything means nothing until you make it something. You are your validator.\n\nBe here now. Be in the moment. The now is the greatest moment of our lives and it just keeps getting better. The bad parts the boring parts the parts with high anxiety. Embrace every moment for its greatness. This is life. This is the greatest movie we will ever see. There's love stories.  Pain happiness. It's 3 dementional. There's taste touch sound. It's the most entertaining for of entertainment. Just being. We believe time is a man made construct. Actually time and money are both man made currency. Because you can spend them both.\n\ntoo much emphasis is put on originality. Feel free to take ideas and update them at your will all great artist take and update. Cars have four wheels. Hoodies have hoods. It's amusing to me when some one says this is an original hoodie. Bro... it's a hoodie \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I find myself getting stuck in the idea of originality and letting my ego push me to say things like \"this person stole this from me\" and the funny thing is it'll be a reference I took from somewhere \ud83d\ude02 let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.\n\ndon't trade your authenticity for approval\n\ntruth is my goal. Controversy is my gym. I'll do a hundred reps of controversy for a 6 pack of truth\n\nif you wanna see the true character of person watch the way they treat someone who can't do anything for them.\n\nApril 19th, 2018\n\ntoday will be the greatest day so far.

The thought police want to suppress freedom of thought.\n\nConstantly bringing up the past keeps you stuck there\n\nWe live in a time where people don\u2019t respect people for being themselves. People respect people for following the general  trend and consensus. There was a time when slavery was the trend and apparently that time is still upon us. But now it's a mentality.\n\nself victimization is a disease\n\nApril 23\n\nwe're evolving at warp speed\n\nnew ideas will no longer be condemned by the masses.

The traditional thinkers are only using thoughts and words but they are in a mental prison. You are free. You've already won. Feel energized. Move in love not fear. Be afraid of nothing.\n\nYou don't have to agree with trump but the mob can't make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother. I love everyone. I don't agree with everything anyone does. That's what makes us individuals. And we have the right to independent thought.\n\nIf your friend jumps off the bridge you don't have to do the same. Ye being Ye is a fight for you to be you. For people In my life the idea of Trump is pretty much a 50 50 split but I don't tell a Hillary supporter not to support Hillary\nI love Hillary too.\n\nI love when people have their own ideas. You don't have to be allowed anymore. Just be. Love who you want to love.  That's free thought. I'm not even political. I'm not a democrat or a republican\n\nAnd also I'm all the way out the sunken place. And I'm not scared anymore. I'm not scared of the media. I'm not scared of the past and I'm optimistic about the future. This tweet is in love not fear.\n\nwith love I am invincible. Truth is subjective but love is the most powerful force in the world and the world needs to express more of it.\n\nI said express love more because we have love but we don't express it.  My friend Tmills will always say \"I love you\" and it used to make me feel weird to hear that. Now I tell everyone I love them.  He sparked me to start expressing love more.\n\nWhen my daughter acts out she actually says afterwards I just want to hear you say I love you more.\n\nno race religion region or political party can argue with the power of love\n\nfear takes strategy   Unlearn linear thinking   Hit you with these zig zag thoughts\n\ndecentralize\n\nburn that excel spread sheet \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude02\n\nwhenever someone mentions the word \"fan\" to me it's super manipulative. It's like \"don't do or say this because of your fans\"  My fans are fans of themselves.\n\nAnd any fan of me wants Ye to be Ye even when they don't agree because I represent the fact that they can be themselves even when people don't agree with them. Drops mic \ud83c\udfa4Yeezy shrug \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nApril 26th, 2018\n\nThough hate is a similar emotion to love. Hate is not the answer.  Love is. just think of someone you hate and try saying even to yourself that you love that person.\n\nThe world is our family\n\nPeople usually don't agree with people who don't agree with them\n\nif you feel something don't let peer pressure manipulate you\n\nthe concept of loving people has a stigma. try telling people you love them it actually feels weird at first. We're really good at hating each other. We have to get good at loving each other.\n\nYour conscience should allow a physical manifestation of your subconscious but right now most peoples conscious is too affected by other people\u2019s thoughts and it creates a disconnect from you doing what you actually feel now. Instead of doing what you feel you just do what other people think you should do.\n\nit's really cool to say I hate you. But it's not cool to say I love you. Love has a stigma\n\nwe are more worried about what we can lose than what we feel\n\nspread love.

I did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money I made touring to follow my passion. I\u2019ve been working at this for 8 years now.

I had this opportunity to intern at Fendi and was also offered a position at Versace which I could not take due to my contract with LV which was for 2 years. I moved to Rome after I left Japan and worked at Fendi for 4 months undercover. I was there to give ideas for the men\u2019s collection. I snuck to Giuseppe Zanotti\u2019s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for 2 years before my first show in Paris. After doing the first LV collection I was sure I would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity\nI designed a sneaker called the (Air) Yeezy with Nike. I\u2019m \u201callowed\u201d to design 1 pair of sneakers every 2 years. I have more ideas\u2026\nEarly 2011 I moved to Paris and opened a small design studio. The language barrier was quite difficult. I still don\u2019t have a Paris VAT number to this day. I don\u2019t know what a VAT is but every time I asked why we didn\u2019t have fabrics they said it was because of the VAT. In Paris I met many great people in design including the master Azzedine Alaia. Azzedine even came by my studio one day :-).

She said I would always point to the most expensive furs, even as a child. LOL. There is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point. For the first 16 or 17 years of my life the only thing I knew about women\u2019s clothing was what my Mom would wear. I guess some critics would joke that I still don\u2019t know anything. LOL. My Mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished \u201cCosby Show\u201d sweater :-) to pick me up from school. The teachers said I couldn\u2019t focus. I used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing Nike\u2019s in 4th grade\nBeing a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively. I was just discussing becoming the creative director for the Jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out, \u201cyou should do a Jetsons tour!\u201d\nThis just happened a few hours ago. I was very insulted of course because for anyone that\u2019s seen the Watch the Throne Tour, Coachella, Glow in the Dark or Runaway know that I have real ideas\nI appreciate having the most nominations at the Grammy\u2019s but I feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical. Good logic tells me \u201csmile Kanye\u201d, the world likes you again. \u201cRed or blue pill?\u201d\u2026aaaaand Swallow. LOL. I wouldn\u2019t have the prestige I have if it wasn\u2019t partially for the Grammy's validation and I honor that\nHmmmmm, what to wear? Here I go again\u2026 Yeezy the trend setter or complete f*cking fashion victim\u2026the verdict is still out. This is just a train of thought but I figure it\u2019s better to read than trained thoughts\nWhat good is fame and prestige if you can\u2019t use it to help people? I want to help by doing what I know how to do best\u2026create\nI have started a new company and I\u2019m so excited about the name\u2026it\u2019s got the best name ever\u2026of all companies\u2026of all time!!!\nThe name of the company is DONDA\nDONDA is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas. I used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out. Dr Dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product. I am assembling a team of architects, graphic designers, directors musicians, producers, A&Rs, writers, publicist, social media experts, app guys, managers, car designers, clothing designers, DJs, video game designers, publishers, tech guys, lawyers, bankers, nutritionists, doctors, scientists and teachers\nDONDA will be comprised of over 22 divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford. I want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me. We want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear, touch, taste and feel. To dream of, create, advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need.. To marry our wants and needs\u2026DONDA\nThis will all take time but I wanted everyone\u2019s to know what I really care about\u2026I care about people\u2026I care about my fans\u2026I care about people who have never heard of me\u2026There are over 7 billion people on the planet now\u2026It\u2019s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic. Music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy. Sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right :-). My mom was an English teacher so I know she sends an SMDH from heaven :-). 5:18 am in London, my dreams keep me woke\nThe Watch the Throne tour was a small example of what a DONDA experience can be\u2026\nI\u2019m currently working on a new 7 screen experience\u2026\n\nThis is one of our projects to be released this year called 2016 Olympics\u2026It\u2019s semi sci-fi, since 2016 is only 4 years away, :-)\nWe would also like to design the MTV awards. We\u2019re taking everything 10 steps at a time, LOL! I wanted to put this in the world, in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out. We need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved. Come get on board\u2026don\u2019t just sit there\u2026reach out\nWe can collectively effect the world through design. We need to pick up where Steve Jobs left off\nWhen I said wealthy I wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education. School systems were designed to turn people into factory workers. Schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life\nSpike Jonze and I want to do a Summer school that tries new forms of curriculum. Math classes should teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, accounting and money management aaaaaand cut!!!\nUNLESS YOU\u2019RE A MATH MAJOR!!! Kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools. Instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iPhones\u2026why not promote it?\nAllow kids to use search engines to do test\u2026like the real WORLD!!! Give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect\u2026please excuse my grammar\u2026I know it\u2019s extremely ironic\nSome kids have better memories than others\u2026what about emotional IQ\u2019s? What about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are?\nExcuse me\u2026I just get excited at the possibilities\u2026the more excited I get the more grammatical errors you\u2019ll see\u2026\nWe need to take what Michael Jackson felt and Mcqueen and Steve Jobs, and we need make things better\nWhen me and Jay toured, every night I peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us\nThe adrenaline is running\u2026I don\u2019t know if I can even get to sleep now. From Wall Street to the London riots to Chicago murders\u2026I sit everyday and ask what can I do to make a difference. I know this is not a very rapper thing to say but I haven\u2019t bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about 2 years\nI invest every dime back into creativity, hiring amazing creatives, paying for flights, offices\u2026etc. My area of expertise is in music, my passion is in music, design, film and products\u2026my strength is connectivity\u2026\nThere are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems\u2026we need experts for this. We need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments\nI just wanted to share what\u2019s been on my mind\u2026\n\u201cIf you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple\u2026but if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.\u201d \u2013 George Bernard Shaw", "year": null}, {"artist": "Kanye West", "album": "Yandhi", "title": "Don't Let Me Down (80 Degrees)*", "lyrics": "Lyrics from Snippet\n\nSeen us in 3-D\n'Fore life start for me, 'fore life start for me\nDoze in the sun breeze\nEighty degrees, warmin' up to me\nI didn't fear finding all of me\nAnd I went out to see, I can walk on the moon\nWhy he never show, I can float on the water\nFather hold me close\nDon't let me down\nI know you won't", "year": "2018-09-29"}, {"artist": "Kanye West", "album": "Kanye West Presents Good Music Cruel Summer", "title": "Don't Like", "lyrics": "[Produced by Young Chop; co-production by Kanye West, Noah Goldstein, and The Twilite Tone]\n\n[Introduction: Pusha T]\nFraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like\nYour shit make-believe, rappin' about my own life\nReal names kill things, that's that shit I won't write\n'Cause my niggas still sellin' dope\nLike they ain't on their third strikes\nCampin' out in that corridor, fuck you waitin' on Jordans for?\nI middle-man it for twenty-three\nJust meet me somewhere 'round Baltimore\n(Woo!)

So, my medium is public opinion and the world is my canvas\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d is something that you can use a lot. It gives you the opportunity to give your opinion, apologize for it, and give your opinion again. People say you should not be sorry for your opinions. George Bush\u2026 has some very cool self-portraits. I didn\u2019t know he was an artist\n\nI felt my nerves a bit, and I don\u2019t feel that feeling a lot. The nerves of humility and modesty when being honored; a humanization, a reality of being recognized. And all I thought as I sit here kinda shaking a little bit is \u201cI need to get rid of that feeling.\u201d I need to not be nervous\n\nThis honor is gonna make your lives easier. Two reasons: you don\u2019t have to defend me as much, and I\u2019m gonna make all of our lives easier. And it\u2019s these Floyd Mayweather belts that are needed to prove what I\u2019ve been saying my entire life.

But just to see the work actually be actualized\nIf I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I\u2019ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way\nAnd I know that there\u2019s more creativity to happen. And I know that there\u2019s traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there\u2019s people in offices that stop the creative people, and [who] are intimidated by actual good ideas\nI believe that utopia is actually possible\u2014but we\u2019re led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician\u2014I\u2019m usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct. I really appreciate you guys\u2019 willingness to learn and hone your craft, and not be lazy about creation\nI\u2019m very inspired to be in this space. Tonight, this show, if you come see it\u2014um, I\u2019m a bit self conscious because I\u2019m showing it to architects. So the stage does have flaws in it.

Fantastic,\u201d Bernard Arnault told a reporter before the concert, which also featured an exhibition of West portraits by photographer Jackie Nickerson\n\nMcQueen related how the project came about\n\n\u201cMe and my daughter were shopping in London at Dover Street Market and I got a phone call from Kanye and he says, \u2018I\u2019m at Dover Street Market, where are you?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m at Dover Street Market,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI always said I would never shoot a music video, and here we did one in 10 days. That\u2019s Kanye: It\u2019s been a wild ride.\u201d\n\nThe director said West played him his entire forthcoming album, \u201cSo Help Me God,\u201d and he decided to blend elements of two tracks, shooting the video at Chatham Dockyard, with West donning a vintage T-shirt, Acne Jeans and his new Kanye West x Adidas Originals Yeezy high-tops\n\nIn an interview after his performance, his wife Kim Kardashian curled up on a sofa manipulating her iPhones, West was unequivocal about how fashion shows, particularly in Paris, nourish his creativity\n\n\u201cAs a musician, I would have never been able to design a show like what you saw tonight if it hadn\u2019t been for my experience in Paris \u2014 learning how to minimize and make design decisions, how we started with just the single light,\u201d said West, a stickler for details who barked at security guards between songs for loitering in front of the giant screens surrounding the stage, upon which images of boiling clouds, waterfalls, stars and smoky forests were projected. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the show,\u201d he pleaded\n\nWhile a divisive figure in fashion \u2014 many are put off by his front-row ubiquity and often surly behavior \u2014 West clearly relishes his role as a cultural lightning rod where style, art and music intersect. The hip-hop artist lauded the creative people \u201cthat work here, the city itself, the music that\u2019s played at the shows, the colors, the palettes. I actually get a lot that I take back and put into music.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s ties to LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton stretch back to 2006, when he performed at a Fendi event in Tokyo, later collaborating with Louis Vuitton on a sneaker range in 2009\n\nMore recently, after meeting at a Givenchy show, West struck up a friendship with Alexandre Arnault, who doffed his Dior Homme jacket at the show and bopped around with his friends, mouthing the words to songs on the playlist, which included \u201cAll of the Lights\u201d and \u201cNi\u2013as in Paris.\u201d\n\nA tour of the foundation building sparked the concert idea. \u201cWhen I saw it, I was just so in love with architecture and the modern space and the way they curated the art. I just asked would it be OK for me to do a performance there,\u201d West said\n\nTickets for the four concerts, which end Tuesday, sold out quickly at 100 euros, or $113, a pop. West said all proceeds would go to charity\n\nMeanwhile, Kardashian had spent part of Saturday at the hairdresser to adjust the color on her new blonde locks, which had assumed a yellow cast, not the platinum she was after\n\n\u201cHe fully got the color right. And it\u2019s so perfect, I\u2019m like, \u2018Don\u2019t make me fly out to Paris every time I need to color my hair,\u2019\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m happy with it. It\u2019s a look. But I have a couple of shoots coming up and everyone is like, \u2018Huh, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nKardashian said Madonna was partly the inspiration\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always had references of Madonna with platinum hair. They\u2019ve been on my computer forever, \u201d she said, letting slip that she would keep the color for an upcoming campaign, but clammed up on the brand\n\nLike West, Kardashian keeps a rein on her image, noting that the black coat slung over her shoulders at the concert, which she took off as the heat intensified, was a C\u00e9line style she altered to her liking, making it slimmer, changing the color from white to black, and adding a fur collar\n\n\u201cMy mom has the one that\u2019s just as is. So I feel like mine\u2019s a little special,\u201d she said\n\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s a really dope coat,\u201d West concurred", "year": null}, {"artist": "Kanye West", "album": null, "title": "Kanye West & Taylor Swift 'Famous' Lyric Phone Conversation", "lyrics": "Kanye: OK, dope.

But right after the song comes out I'm gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they're gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me.\nTaylor: \u2026awesome that you're so outspoken and it's gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous!

Can y'all blame him?\nIt was straight embarrassing how y'all played him\nLast year shoppin my demo, I was tryin' to shine\nEvery motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme\nNow I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem\nOr use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams\nI use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed\nBut without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh\nSo I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more\nYou niggas wear suits cause you can't dress no more\nYou can't say shit to Kanye West no more\nI rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga\nI'm Kan, the Louis Vuitton Don\nBought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom\nI ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards\nI prayed to the skies and I changed my stars\nI went to the malls and I balled too hard\n\"Oh my god, is that a black card?\"\nI turned around and replied, \"Why yes\nBut I prefer the term African American Express\"\nBrains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell\nYour boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to\nKillin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit\nMayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips\n\n[Hook: Kanye West]\nAnd I am\n(Here's to the Roc)\nAnd they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them\n(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)\nRaise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and\n(Here's to the Roc)\nThis is the last call for alcohol, for the\n(Mr. Rockefeller)\nSo get your ass up off the wall\n\n\"... last call for alcohol, for my niggas\"\n\n[Outro]\nSo this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the \"Truth\" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like \"Who that spittin?\" I'm like \"It's me.\" He's like \"Oh, well okay.\"\nUhh, he started talkin to me on the phone, going back and forth\nJust askin me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with\n\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\nSo won't you raise your glass won't you\n\nAnd um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, \"Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap\"\n\nNo ID: \"Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap\"\n\n[Saxophone Solo]\n\nI was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer\n\n[Hiphop: \"I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper\"]\n\nI'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that \"Truth\" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off \"Xxplosive\" and put it like with a sped up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on \"This Can't be Life.\"\n\nAnd that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, \"Oh you a real soulful dude.\"\n\n[Jay-Z: \"Oh you a real soulful dude, man\"]\n\nAnd he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said\n\n[Jay-Z: \"Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here\"]\n\n\"Tell me what you think of this.\" And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, \"What you think of it?\"\n\n[Jay-Z: \"so what you think of this?\"]\n\nAnd I was like, \"Man that shit tight,\" you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...\n\n[Mother: \"Come on, let's just go\"]\n\n...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...\n\n[Mother: \"Kanye, baby, we're here\"]\n\n...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, \"Heart of the City.\" And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did \"Nothing Like It\" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\n[Hiphop: \"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"]\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n[Dame: \"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"]\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\n[Dame: \"Jay got classics, G.\"]\n\nYou know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said \"man that was tight.\"\n\n[Jay-Z: \"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"]\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say \"naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\n[Jessica: \"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"]\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up\n\n[\"Y'all niggas is stupid\"]\n\nLet's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad\n\n[Joe: \"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"]\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\n[Dame: \"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"]\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\n\n\"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got eleven plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"\n\nLike the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n[Dame: \"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"]\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\n[Dame: \"it's actually kinda hot.\"]\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n[Dame: \"you don't wanna catch a brick\"]\n\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\n[Mel: \"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"]\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\n\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...", "year": "2004-02-10"}, {"artist": "Kanye West", "album": "Freshmen Adjustment Vol. 2", "title": "Last Night", "lyrics": "[Hook: John Legend]\nLast night I dreamt of an angel\nI almost passed away you're yesterday but I'm blessed today\nOn top of the world acts so painful\nIt ain't no mystery, it's meant for me to make history\n\n[Verse: Kanye West]\nNiggas thought I couldn't rhyme but I tricked 'em\nMy pulse quickened, I\nBrought myself outta last place, I Michael Vick'd 'em\nNiggas thought I let 'em down like Tyson\nI got the belt like Lewis\nI took these beats, I passed 'em to myself, I'm Kordell Stewart\nBack on the corner, back on the block\nThe Quincy Jones of hip hop, it's my time like Warner\nSince I shine like Shyne in '99 with his\nA lot of people talkin' real outta like with this\nThere's a war going on a few bitches wanna start with me\nShowing the New World, I'mma Order even more of me\nSo I can live forever like diamonds\nThrow your diamonds up, cause almost dying ain't stop me from rhyming\nI hate a deadbeat nigga that rely on his man\nSee he'll lie on his dick but won't lie on the stand\nAnd go to every single barbershop and lie to the fans\nSo it's time for Kanye to put the Chi on again\nI'm the 2003, Do Or D-I-E\nThey trying to say the best nigga is Twista, then me\nIt's all R.O.C., it's all family tree\nI got that new G5 he got that new Hum-Vee\nIncorporate Young Hov and that's The Blueprint 3\nAnd The Blueprint 2 is 3 mil right now\nSo cut all that, \"I don't like Bonnie & Clyde shit out\nListen\n\n[Bridge: John Legend + Sample]\nOooh hooo\nI got nowhere to\nOooh hooo\nI got nowhere to\nOooh hooo\nI got nowhere to\n\n[Bridge: Kanye West]\nDawg, there's nowhere to hide\nAll I got is my pride\nI almost died\nI keep that 2Pac feeling alive\nYou have no idea how I'm feeling inside\nIt's the Roc throw your diamonds up in the sky\n\n[Hook: John Legend]", "year": null}, {"artist": "Kanye West", "album": "Late Registration", "title": "Late", "lyrics": "[Produced by Kanye West]\n\n[Intro]\nLittle girl (A-ha-ha-ha-ha...)\nPlease stop your crying\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll be late for that, baby, I'll wait for that\nIf you had a taste of that, you'd probably pay for that\nI'm comin' in when I feel like\nSo turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right\nI'll be late for that, I can't wait for that\nI think I was made for that\nSo I'm comin' in when I feel like\nSo turn this motherfucker up only if it feels right\n\n[Verse 1]\nStop all your blood clot cryin', I was flyin'\nMade it to school with barely enough time to sign in\nYeah, I hear the alarm, yeah, I hear you, Mom\nYeah, yeah, I don't wan' be broke when I'm thirty-one\nThey said the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West\nThere's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get\nNot even electives?

Bro. Listen to the kids. Jeremy, I need, I gotta put it down for a second. It\u2019s beautiful.

I think about, when I\u2019m in the grocery store with my daughter, and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice and, you know. And at the end they say, \"Oh, you\u2019re not that bad after all.\" And like, I think about it sometimes. Like, it crosses my mind a bit like when I go to a baseball game. And um, sixty thousand people boo me. Crosses my mind a little bit. And I think if I had to do it all again what would I have done?\n\nWould I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience Y\u2019all know y\u2019all drink that bottle too.

I-I didn\u2019t know how to say the right thing. The perfect thing. I just, I sat at the Grammy\u2019s and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future-Love... \"SexyBack\" album, and bro\u2026.Justin I ain\u2019t tryna put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. You know, and I was thinking like, \"He deserve to win Album of the Year.\"\n\nAnd this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this shit they run about beef and that, sometimes I feel like I died for an artist's opinion, for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I\u2019m not no politician bro. And look at that, you know how many times MTV ran that footage again, cause it got them more ratings? You know how many times they announced Taylor was gonna give me the award, cause it got them more ratings? Listen to the kids bro!\n\nI still don\u2019t understand award shows, I don\u2019t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don\u2019t understand it bro. I don\u2019t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don\u2019t understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more. But fuck that bro!\n\nTwo thousand and fifteen. I will die for the art for what I believe in and the art ain't always gonna be polite.

We the millennials bro, this is a new, this is a new mentality. We not gonna control our kids with brands. We\u2019re not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids, we\u2019re gonna teach our kids that they can be something. We gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves. We gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves. If my grandfather was here right now, he would not let me back down.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m finna lose after this.

I mean, this is what I\u2019m talking about, this is what I\u2019m talking about\n\nHow many people tonight have ever talked to somebody right, that you know they\u2019ll say, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with Kanye or make it seem like I\u2019m a bad person in some way, right? Now what have I ever done that was so wrong other than believe in myself? Now believing in yourself is so, so, so wrong that the other side is so, so, so, so strong, they\u2019re trying to beat down and demonize and dishumanize \u2014 I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a word or not, but it\u2019s now a word, cuz I said it\u2019s a fucking word \u2014 and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves. Cuz then what happens? Then you believe in yourself. And then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible. How many people believe that what they dream about, what y\u2019all want to do, whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer, a designer, a musician, video-game programmer, a lighting guy, a manager \u2026 how many people want to contribute something to the world?\n\nYou see, I know you all might have seen some of my interviews and seen me on TV, but what I was saying the whole time is, what I was saying the whole time is, cuz I\u2019m not \u2014 [to stagehand] making it lighter, make it lighter, the second, the second light \u2014 I\u2019m not particularly angry or anything like that, but what I\u2019m saying is, they taking the idea of celebrity and trying to make me seem I was stupid or something. You know, when I take these meanings and shit, [crowd chants \u201cKanye\u201d] people they talk to you like you\u2019re stupid or something. And then you look back and say, you know, like I\u2019m not gonna call no names out, I\u2019m not going to mention Nike or nothing like that. I\u2019m not going to say no names or anything\n\nBut if you\u2019re a creative and you want to create, and you just want to create more, this is exactly what I\u2019ve been fighting for. So if you hear me talking about Louis Vuitton or the Gucci Group or anything like that. I\u2019m not dissing Louis Vuitton, I\u2019m not dissing the Gucci Group and shit. I\u2019m just saying, don\u2019t discriminate against me, because I\u2019m a black man or because I\u2019m a celebrity, and tell me that I can create, but not feel. Cuz you know damn well there aren\u2019t no black guys or celebrities making no Louis Vuitton nothing. They let Pharrell make those glasses, and we liked them, right? They let me make those shoes, and we liked them right?\n\nAnd they say, \u201cNo, no, no, nigga. Not no more. That\u2019s too much. That\u2019s too much. No, no, no, no, no, no, nigga not no more. That\u2019s way too much. That\u2019s way too much. Stay in your place. Sit in the front of that show and wear this jacket I made you. Stay in your place. Do what you get paid to do. Stay in your place. Don\u2019t embarrass yourself trying to chase your dreams. Save face. Save face.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why I got this fucking mask on, cuz I ain\u2019t worried about saving face. Fuck my face! Let\u2019s set \u2018em off. Pause. Now they finally got a headline. But fuck whatever my face is supposed to mean! Fuck whatever Kanye is supposed to mean! It\u2019s about my dreams. It\u2019s about everybody\u2019s dreams. It\u2019s about creating. It\u2019s not about the idea of being a fucking celebrity, it\u2019s not about the idea of a black man trying to do fashion and shit. Cuz these walls that I break down, these walls that I break down and we will\n\nAnd I\u2019m arguing with my friend Spike Jonze in the car cuz he said, Kanye, what you need to say is you\u2019re gonna try. You\u2019re gonna try to break them down. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re just going to do it. And I said, I am gonna do it! I told Kim seven years ago, I\u2019m gonna marry you! And I\u2019m telling you right now as I stand on this stage, all this shit that you heard me talking about, I\u2019m gonna come and back all that shit up. You don\u2019t know how hard it was to get the Nikes, that wasn\u2019t my fault. They try to control y\u2019all and try to control me. And when I was in my negotiations, they told me, \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate with celebrities.\u201d That\u2019s like a terrorist. They talk to you like it\u2019s fucking terrorist\n\nYou know, I just want to make something awesome. I just want to be awesome, and I want to hang around my awesome friends and change the fucking world, and that\u2019s exactly what I plan to do. And if you plan to do the same, put your hands in the air right now.

It\u2019s like: why don\u2019t you just do music? It\u2019s an overall creative expression. Like I have a friend, Yves B\u00e9har, that designed the Jawbone wristband and stuff, and the Jambox and everything. As a designer, you know, he's not in a box to only design, you know, a speaker. He can design whatever he wants and I'm like, that's the type of creative expression and freedom any creative, you know, wants.\n\nAnd as, you know, get really successful at one thing you start to grow, and you're like - you feel like you can do more things, and your shoe starts to get a little bit tight, and you do everything you can to get a bigger shoe so you can walk further and run faster.

I've been thinking about going backstage and not saying nothing at all, is that cool? Uhh, before I go back there I got to ask you one question. Just one real quick. Just one. CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? It's like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause I've been putting up with they shit just way too long. I'm so gifted at finding what they don't like the most. So if they find that they don't like the most\n\nYou know, it's so interesting cause they're trying to make me, like you just read the, Don't me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. [?]. It's the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, it's funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know it's like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didn't understand, like they just didn't understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud?\n\nI had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs. I had a dream that I was Walt Disney. I had a dream that I was The Wright Brothers. I had a dream that I was Thomas Edison. I had a dream that I was Mandela. I had a dream that I was Martin Luther King. I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream. I had a dream, I had a dream. And I'm not afraid to dream out loud. You know you just get so scared that people are gonna think you're crazy, or that you're stupid, or that you're foolish, or this is the time that everybody thinks you're losing your mind, but I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind! I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm not losing, I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what I'm saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me. And if what I'm saying offends you, and makes you feel like the worst you, than that's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true\n\nCause there's only two types of people, there's dreamers and there's haters. There's dreamers and there's haters. And all I've been doing recently is cutting the grass real low. So if you a dreamer, everybody will know. And if you a hater, make yourself be seen, CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU, THATS WHAT I MEAN! Cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low.

Put your hands up if you think anything is possible. Put your hands up if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible. Cause God made us in his image. And God made us all artists as children, God made us all artists as children. And somehow that peer pressure takes the artist out of you. Somehow the world can leave you so [?] confused, and you forget who you are. But I'm remembering, I'm remembering, I'm remembering\n\nCause most people, you know they say, they say people in my position, what ever that position is, like a celebrity or you make money, you have some type of status or some shit, you don't wanna fuck it up right? You don't wanna ruin your name, you don't wanna say anything wrong. So what you do is you get on TV you just smile, you just wave, and you try to be as safe as possible, cause you don't wanna fuck up enough, BUT I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP!!! I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP! I WANNA FUCK UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 'CAUSE I'm STILL BEATING! As long as my heart is beating, as long as I'm dreaming.

As a matter of fact I\u2019m just going to tip-toe on this\n\nI\u2019m scared of anonymous comments online. I\u2019m scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn\u2019t give me already. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared.  I\u2019m so shook. I\u2019m so, so scared. So scared. Soooo\n\nYou ain\u2019t never seen, you ain\u2019t ever seen, that my great, great, great, granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat. Somehow he ended up on that boat. But I know that we were royalty. I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y\u2019all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y\u2019all for giving me this moment in time. \u2019Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There\u2019s so many people have a moment and they don\u2019t own it\n\nYou know, it\u2019s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there\u2019s the connotation of that. But what I need y\u2019all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y\u2019all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y\u2019all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius\n\n\u2019Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it\u2019s like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you\u2019re an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you\u2019re a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouth\n\nYou watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don\u2019t, you don\u2019t want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they\u2019re not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren\u2019t going to talk about the money we made. They\u2019re going to talk about the impact we had. They\u2019re going to talk about the impact we had\n\nAnd being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, \u201cBaby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.\u201d And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn\u2019t be no song called \u201cNiggas in Paris\u201d if it wasn\u2019t for Lenny Kravitz. \u2019Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. Star\n\nBut what\u2019s interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. \u2019Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don\u2019t know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long time\n\nAnd the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he\u2019s at the such and such show, and that\u2019s gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you can\n\nSo I said, \u201cWait a second, though.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,\u201d and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said,  \u201cLenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.\u201d They said, \u201cLenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.\u201d Don\u2019t let me sing because I want y\u2019all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, \u201cHey that\u2019s cute, that\u2019s the same thing Lenny wanted to do.\u201d Like it\u2019s a motherfucking joke. It wouldn\u2019t be no Kanye west if it wasn\u2019t for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I\u2019m saying?\n\nBut the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don\u2019t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don\u2019t want to break their motherfucking cool, don\u2019t nobody want to look like a fool\nMy boy [?], who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn\u2019t heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don\u2019t know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they\u2019re trying to make me look stupid? You know what I\u2019m saying, like I\u2019m actually stupid. (Laughs) You know what I\u2019m saying, like I\u2019m not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I\u2019m saying? Have y\u2019all ever read or heard someone say, \u201cI don\u2019t like Kanye West\u201d?\n\nI\u2019ll tell you something. Have you ever heard anyone talk shit about Lenny Kravitz though? He\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s so well-mannered. I envy manners. I envy it. I envy people who are extremely likeable. I\u2019m like, \u201cDamn, I wish I could be likeable like them.\u201d I wish people would like me like that\n\nSo what they basically did was, at Fashion Week\u2026 Let me explain something to you\u2026 I don\u2019t give a fuck about fashion. I care about talent. I care about creativity. And it just so happens that with the advent of the Louis Vuitton bag, fashion rise to the top, and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box, and sell it back to you at a higher price. That\u2019s what the fuck fashion is to me. I care about dreamers. I care about heart. I care about soul. Not those who are marginalized\n\nSo if you think about someone like McQueen. Instead of being forced to make some fucking T-shirts with a skull on it, why wasn\u2019t he allowed to make movies? He was just as good as Tarsem, he\u2019s just a good a visualist as anyone else. But they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer. Which, let\u2019s rewind, is above a music producer, and it\u2019s above a rapper\n\n\u2019Cause you gotta stay in your tier, in your section. You gotta stay right there, you can\u2019t move. But if you pay for a ticket, you wanted to come to see this show, and you standing right there, right? And when you\u2019re trying to go you say I want to go up there, a security guard stops you, and then holds you, and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you, catch you with your face looking all crazy, and then you scream out loud, and you got to really scream, you gotta say, \u201cI am a god!\u201d Just for them to let you a little bit up\n\nBut you know who fucked it up for everyone? Marc Jacobs. Because he gave two niggas a shot, me and Pharrell. He fucked the whole game up, and Pharell\u2019s such a nice guy. \u2019Cause soon as I was able to make that Louis Vuitton sneaker, and the world reacted\u2014I didn\u2019t price it, but the world reacted to it\u2014I got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility. And wait a second, the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this [gestures back to his stage setup], that\u2019s worn Jordans his whole life, could create a sneaker with Louis Vuitton and people reacted to that. And I said, I made another color. I did a pink model, and I did a red model, and I named them after my friends. I made one in Jasper after Ivan Jasper and one Mr. Hudson after Mr. Hudson, and one, the Louis Vuitton Don, for my nigga Don C. And that last day in the factory, I was going through the colors and it came to me, when they made me do a couple pictures and shit, and I called back after they sold out. And they said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. West, but you\u2019re not going to be able to create anything else in here. You\u2019re not going to be able to create anything else again.\u201d They said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and I said, \u201cBut wait a second. I sold out.\u201d They said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Mr. West, you can never create anything else again.\u201d\n\nAnd right there, I was scared. Right there I was scared. \u2019Cause I thought that if I just went to their fashion show again and I just sat down like a good nigga they would let Lenny Kravitz get his shot! I thought maybe, maybe they would let Pharell get his shot. But no, no, no. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you? \u2019Cause that\u2019s what it is. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you?\n\nAnd what about Mark Parker, and what about Hedi Slimane? I thought Hedi Slimane was my friend, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so hurt. How many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when I\u2019m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit, that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit? I thought I was Hedi Slimane designing motherfuckin\u2019 tight jeans that you want. I\u2019m the nigga that, you know I\u2019m rocking that shit. Then he had his first fashion show, and I was so happy for him. I was so, so, so happy for him. And he told me, you can come to my show, but you just can\u2019t go to Riccardo\u2019s show and you can\u2019t go to Phoebe\u2019s show\n\nBut he wouldn\u2019t say that to Anna Wintour. He wouldn\u2019t say that to [?]. And now his whole shit based off of rock and roll, and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go? So he can sell y\u2019all, some motherfucking $10,000 pair of jeans? Fuck fashion. Fuck fashion. I mean, what\u2019s the worst thing they gonna do, not help me again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do tell me I can\u2019t go to these shows again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do, tell me that because I\u2019m a musician, I don\u2019t have any ideas for clothing again? What\u2019s the worst they gonna do, marginalize me again? And never let Pharrell get his shot, and never let Lenny get his shot?\n\nBut I\u2019mma tell y\u2019all right now, I will take that spot. I am 2Pac of this clothing shit.  And I\u2019mma take that spot, and we gonna combine all the creators, the best creators on the planet, and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices, so everybody can get it. And we ain\u2019t gonna steal from people\u2019s ideas like H&M. And we ain\u2019t gonna steal people\u2019s ideas like Zara. We gon\u2019 make our own shit. We gon\u2019 combine the best creators on the planet, and we gon\u2019 take them from Harvard, and we gon\u2019 take them from St. Mark's, and we gon\u2019 take \u2019em from the street\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin\u2019 hit song tonight. I\u2019m so sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin\u2019 hit song tonight. Hit song tonight, hit song tonight. Another hit song, another hit song. Yes they do. I ask people about it, I tell them that I\u2019m this creator, and they say I need another hit song. They say I need another hit song, hit song tonight, hit song\u2026\n\nHold up, hold up.

It doesn\u2019t matter!\n\nIt might have been a reporter who wanted to use this as an opportunity to say, \u201cOh, this rapper\u201d because when they call me a rapper they try to say that I\u2019m less than thinking, less than a philosopher. But rappers are the philosophers of our now. The rappers all form a sense of our now. The celebrities are the influencers of our now. Just look at the president. He wasn\u2019t even in politics and he won! That shows you not if you mad about him winning, but that shows you the level of possibility that is out there if you go and find information and don\u2019t believe everything the fucking internet is telling you! There is possibilities! There\u2019s possibilities inside of books. There\u2019s possibilities when you call grandmother. Motherfuckers be on the internet way more than they calling they mother or they grandmother. To get information that would have you wrong as fuck like everybody knows a couple days ago! Do you ever want to be blindsided like that?\n\nDon\u2019t trivialize what I was saying when I talked about our president\u2019s approach to the campaign when I said it was entertaining. I don\u2019t think his approach was just entertaining, because that trivializes it, I actually think that his approach was absolutely genius because it fucking worked! Next song.\n\nOh shit, you threw something at me. Does anyone else wanna throw something at me? But, you know what, I got the power to get that guy kicked out, or whatever, roughed up. No. Stay here. What do you believe? That\u2019s your opinion. Express your opinion, bro. Express your opinion. Thank you. That\u2019s a woman right there saying, \u201cI love you,\u201d after I just said that there was things that I liked about Trump\u2019s campaign. That\u2019s not supposed to happen, right? No! That\u2019s not supposed to happen, right? Case in point. Aw, no. Well, no. I guess we\u2019re not gonna sell out the rest of the tour now. There\u2019s methods, nonpolitical methods to speaking that I like that I feel were very futuristic and that style and that method of communication has proven that it can be a politically correct way of communication. And I fuck with that. You threw something at me! Naw, he wanted me to sign his Yeezy.\n\nI don\u2019t say 2020 out of disrespect to our president at all. I\u2019m not saying that, \u201cAw man, that just mean that anybody can win.\u201d That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying when I say 2020. I\u2019ll just say I got some ideas about the way that we should connect our ideas. And we should use opposite parties that the Republicans, that the Democrats, that everyone that ran that had an idea that people agreed with should be the collective ideas that are used to run the country. And that should mean more. So there's things that Benjamin Carson believes in... that I believe in. I believe that Benjamin Carson should still be a consultant. I think that Hillary Clinton should still be a consultant. I think that Bill Clinton should still be a consultant. Obama said... I think Obama should still be a consultant. It\u2019s that, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t fuck with your principles so now I\u2019m not gonna give you no information that could help you help all of us.\u201d Make sure this dude that got the Yeezy get his Yeezy back, specifically. Hey, security, get it back.\n\nMan, and you know what also? I\u2019m not saying this to diss celebrity and that all who are particularly on the Democratic side, that\u2019s cool, I just like... I hate the fact that because I\u2019m a celebrity everybody told me not to say that I loved the debates. I loved his approach. It\u2019d be like white people that\u2019s racist running around saying \u201cniggas\u201d now. If people are racist and they feel more inspired to say how they feel then they exposing themselves, bro. This is what I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s already the beginning of change. Sometimes things that you might think are bad have to happen in order for change to fucking happen. Sometimes you might have to not get your way to really understand what to do in the future to be able to get your way.", "year": "2016-11-17"}, {"artist": "Kanye West", "album": "Kanye West's Visionary Streams of Consciousness", "title": "On Wiz Khalifa", "lyrics": "Oh niggas must think I'm not petty cause I'm the best that's ever made music\n\nLike, oh that's Ye and I can put his wife's initials on my twitter   @Wizkhalifa\n\nBro first of all you stole your whole shit from Cudi\n\nSecond, your first single was corny as fuck and most there after\n\nWork hard play hard\nYou have distracted from my creative process\n\nI went to look at your twitter and you were wearing cool pants\n\nI screen grabbed those pants and sent it to my style team #Wizwearscoolpants\n\n3rd no one I know has ever listened to one of your albums all the way through\n\n4th you let a stripper trap you\n\n5th    I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years\n\n6th  don't ever come out the side of your neck at me\n\n7th I am your OG    and I will be respected as such\n\n8th  I made it so we could wear tight jeans\n\n9th   me and Cudi created this shit\n\n10th   don't you ever in your fucking life speak sideways about a nigga that's fighting for us    I do this for all of us\n\n11th   I showed you respect as a man when I met you\n\n12th   You wouldn't have a child if it wasn't for me\n\n13th   You own waves????

I wanted to vibe off an idea, and then I can riff off of that\u2026they said I\u2019ve got 20 minutes or so, I might go longer\n\nOK, everyone please be completely quiet, because I can literally hear a whisper, and it\u2019ll throw off my stream of consciousness, and when I get my stream of consciousness going that\u2019s when I give the best, illest quotes. Literally, a whisper can throw it off\n\nToday was the first time I realised, If I could have done it again I would have gone to the Art Institute over the American Academy of Art, I would have researched where I could have got the best and the strongest education\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure this will end up online, so I don\u2019t want to diss anyone at the American Academy, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s equal to the Art Institute of Chicago by now, but at the time I was going I would look around at the work of the class and not feel inspired by the teachers, and I kinda, the idea of being a fine artist, that\u2019s a really difficult profession to get into, to be respected in, to make money at.  Maybe the goal for some of the people was just to work at an advertising agency or at a record label\n\nMy goal, if I was going to do art, fine art, would have been to become Picasso or greater\n\nThat always sounds so funny to people, comparing yourself to someone in the past that has done so much, and in your life you\u2019re not even allowed to think that you can do as much. That\u2019s a mentality that suppresses humanity\n\nSome of you here probably remember the night when the Donda tweets came through me and I started talking about professions that you guys are going into, that seemed they had nothing to do with a rapper. I was talking about a band of thinkers that could remove religion, race, gender, and somehow come together to find solutions for a broken planet\n\nWe have the resources as a civilization to find a utopia, but we\u2019re led by the most greedy and the least noble\n\nWhat I notice about creatives is that, and one of the reasons why I get into trouble, is, not only do I want to design video games, or make music, or ride bikes, I think one of the most important things to my ability to create so much in the past 30 years is my desire to play sports. I approach creativity like a sport, where if I have a drawing I react just like a jock: LOOK AT THE FUCKING DRAWING RIGHT THERE YEAH!\n\nWe\u2019re all creatives here, we\u2019re all born artists. Some people are artists of business, some people are artists of composition\n\nWe were taught to hide our black fingernail polish and put our head down in the back of the class and not notice out of fear that someone might laugh at one of our ideas \u2013 that our idea could become a mockery or a failure in some way\n\nThere\u2019s a Bible saying, \u2018No weapon formed against me shall prosper\u2019. Recently I\u2019ve been doing interviews and I\u2019ve had to go back to this verse because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them, but I also don\u2019t think there\u2019s one more prosperous. So what weapons have prospered? The smoke and mirrors of other opinions\n\nI was sitting with Steve McQueen, he shot the visuals for All Day two days ago, it\u2019s completely different to the Brit awards\n\nSo it doesn\u2019t get taken out of context, I\u2019m going to use the word \u2018like\u2019. I\u2019m not saying it is, I\u2019m using it as a comparison. So people that want to say \u2018Kanye goes to Oxford and tells everyone blah blah blah\u2019. And I\u2019m not telling you this. I\u2019m telling you what I told Steve McQueen in private\n\nWhat I said was The Matrix is like the Bible of the post-information age\n\nI compared it like, when the hundred guys come at Neo, those are opinions, that\u2019s perception, that\u2019s tradition. Attacking people from every which angle possible. If you have a focus wide and master senses like Laurence Fishburne and you have a squad behind you, you literally can put the world in slow motion\n\nIt\u2019s still February, right? (security guard shakes his head, everyone laughs)\n\nBy the way, I don\u2019t know the days of the week. I just go to exactly when my appointment is\n\nWe\u2019d just look at each other and say, it\u2019s still February. For the sheer mount of work that we were able to put into the world. Some of the stuff had been worked on for years coming, months coming. But nonetheless they came back to back to back to back. Answering every crazy interview question, blocking every shot, catching every rebound. Aside from the right I don\u2019t have to give my opinion publicly about artists, I probably would have been batting 2000. I know that\u2019s incorrect also\n\nThis humanity that I talk about, this civilization that I talk about, this future utopia I talk about\u2026it can only happen through collaboration\n\nI love Steve Jobs, he\u2019s my favorite person, but there\u2019s one thing that disappoints me. When Steve passed he didn\u2019t give the ideas up. That\u2019s kinda selfish. You know that Elon\u2019s like \u2018yeah, take these ideas\u2019. Maybe there are companies outside of Apple that could work on them and push humanity forward. Maybe the stock brokers won\u2019t like that, the stock holders wouldn\u2019t like that idea, but ideas are free and you can\u2019t be selfish with them\n\nI think that progression of mind with the advent of a human being named Drake (laughs, smirks, crowd laughs) you know, this idea of holding onto a number 1 spot. And then you get this guy that comes and blows out the water every number 1 of any band ever. Be it me, or Paul McCartney [laughs]\n\nI understand that I\u2019m a servant. And with my voice, with my ability to build relationships with amazing people, speak to amazing people. Call Elon Musk out of the blue, or call Obama out of the blue\u2026he calls the home phone, by the way\n\nWith that, I have a responsibility to serve. Why do I say the Matrix is like the Bible? What is my definition of the Matrix? [he never answered this]\n\nI work with an artist called Vanessa Beecroft, and she bought my daughter some toys\n\nI\u2019d see toys that some people would buy for my daughter and I\u2019d say this toy isn\u2019t quality. I don\u2019t want my daughter playing with this. There\u2019s not enough love put into this, this is just manufactured with the will to sell, and not the will of inspiration\n\nVanessa is very focused, she\u2019s like my eyes, she\u2019s a piece of my brain. She bought my daughter these three wolves, knowing the whole collection, that it\u2019d play with the song Wolves, and based on this concept. And when my daughter saw these wolves, I\u2019ve never seen her so happy. She was going so crazy, she was grabbing one, she was riding on top of one\u2026I\u2019ve never seen her happier than this moment. That level of happiness seems to be the thing that we\u2019re fighting for every day, that we\u2019re trying to buy back, trying to work for, especially in America\n\nIn America people really do wear $3000 shirts. For real. Here and in Stockholm people will be like \u2018oh dude, it\u2019s a $3000 shirt\u2019\n\nI\u2019m assuming I\u2019m probably wearing a $2000 shirt but I got it for free from the designer so\n\nWe\u2019ve been sold a concept of joy through advertising, through car advertising, through fashion branding. It\u2019s not the concept of time, time with your family, time with your friends, the little time that we do have on earth and what we do with that. It was somehow sold to us through a Gucci bag or something\n\nTime is the only luxury. It\u2019s the only thing you can\u2019t get back. If you lose your luggage \u2013 I\u2019m not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that I\u2019d normally say because I\u2019ve got a meeting with them soon \u2013 if you lose your expensive luggage at the airport, you can get that back. You can\u2019t get the time back\n\nIt feels like people do everything in life to get this BMW, this Benz, to get this townhome, to get 2.5 kids exactly. One of them has to be small, y\u2019know!\n\nAnd you\u2019re looking for this moment where you sit in your BMW after all the work you\u2019ve done and all the accolades you get, and you somehow think you\u2019re gonna get that level of joy that my daughter had when she received those wolves. And when you\u2019re sitting in traffic in your BMW, it\u2019s something that feels empty. To everyone who reaches that point. This concept of the selfish human, this idea of separation by race, or gender, or religion, or age, or my favourite thing to hate, class\n\nPeople say it takes a village to raise a child. People ask me how my daughter is doing. She\u2019s only doing good if your daughter\u2019s doing good. We\u2019re all one family\n\nWe have the ability to approach our race like ants, or we have the ability to approach our race like crabs\n\nThis is a generation that is far less racist \u2013 yes, small remnants remain of even thinking of calling something of a racial slur\n\nWhite people that listen to rap say \u2018nigger\u2019\u2026in the privacy of their own home\n\nThat idea [racism], has passed. We\u2019ve had The Cosby Show, Obama\u2019s president, Beyonce\u2019s great\u2026that\u2019s passed. But there\u2019s still something you\u2019re taught every day, especially in the UK, and that\u2019s division by class. Our main focus, in my opinion\u2026Imagine a world with no war, and imagine if everyone\u2019s main focus, more so than going out to a club, their main focus was to help someone else\n\nI was joking with an interviewer earlier today\u2026people talk about the number of viewers the Brits get, or the number of viewers the Grammys get. They need to do award shows for the Nobel Peace Prize, but I guess that doesn\u2019t sell as many MasterCard commercials. Oh, I mentioned a brand! [looks disappointed]\u2026I had two things\u2026I was trying to get a flawless victory on my speech! No offence to MasterCard\u2026but that was a big fucking logo in the middle!\n\nYou guys have been taught, without you knowing, ways to separate yourselves from each other. If you\u2019re separated, you can be easily controlled. If you\u2019re too busy pointing fingers at each other, rather than holding hands, you can\u2019t get anything done\n\nYou know, Chris Rock called my album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u2026well, Chris Rock and everyone else at every single media publication called My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy the best album of the last 25 years. This only came through collaboration\n\nOne of the most memorable things about MBDTF was Nicki Minaj, and the fact that she kicked my ass, on my own song, on one of the best albums\u2026the best album \u2013 I\u2019m just saying what the critics said \u2013 of the last 25 years. The best album of the past 25 years that I spent a year and a half making, out there. I was exiled from my country, it was a personal exile, but exile. To come back and deliver my magnum opus of a work, and to be outshined\u2026to be beat by a girl, basically\n\nThis was necessary. I think it was one of the most important points of working on that album, was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is. Just think of a comparison, if you think about why did it take so long for the new Yeezys to come out? Why did I have to leave one group and go to another group? Why did that group not want to speak to me? I think the Yeezys I was doing over there were comparable to that Nicki Minaj verse. Because these guys were like \u2018we\u2019re worrying about this shoe, we\u2019re gonna put it on this celebrity\u2019. And the head\u2019s son would come and say \u2018my favourite shoe is the Yeezy\u2019. And it\u2019s like \u2018ahhh, I can\u2019t hear about these YEEZYS anymore!\u2019. Like everyone talking about Nicki\u2019s verse, \u2018I can\u2019t hear about this verse anymore!\u2019. It was gonna work for her anyway, but let\u2019s just say that in some way in helped give her exposure. She was able to go on and become a successful, and fly, and run, and dream, and provide. And it was not locked because of my career\n\nOne of my biggest Achilles heels has been my ego. And if I, Kanye West, the very person, can remove my ego, I think there\u2019s hope for everyone\n\nWhen I talk about collaboration and the creative process, the best idea wins\n\nI\u2019m proud of the consistency of the performances I\u2019ve done since I\u2019ve been out here. And it comes from four would-be egomaniacs coming out and being forced to work together. The best lighting guy on the planet, the best staging guy, the best video guy, another staging guy, a guy with a laptop for no reason\u2026To be able to deliver, back to back to back, extremely successful, inspiring, groundbreaking, visual, visceral, creative moments that otherwise would have been challenged. And the kid from Chicago screaming from the top of the stage for 40 minutes in a row. I\u2019ve had to pull that card out a few times. Not particularly screaming, but remember, I will scream\n\nMy momma taught me that if I was in a grocery store and I\u2019m by myself and a stranger grabbed my hand, scream at the top of your fucking lungs. If I\u2019m at an awards show and a stranger grabs my hand and they say so we\u2019re going to use these moving lights, or we\u2019re gonna play the music right now before we define the look, or we\u2019re gonna cut the TV cameras in a traditional way. I\u2019ll scream at the top of my fucking lungs\n\nPeople say I have a bad reputation. I think I\u2019ve got the best reputation in the building. They want you to have a reputation of tucking your black nail polish into your pockets and sitting in the corner of the class, and not fighting for your ideas out of fear of being ridiculed\n\nThat\u2019s one of my favourite ones\u2026to be called crazy\n\nI remember when I was young and saw my dad working on computers. And the guy he was working with ended up being a bad guy. And the guys that helped him, that he had the voice to find, didn\u2019t have the same motivation, a high enough skill set to match up to his vision, to his dream, for it to be considered to be a success. But the success is that his successor will be successful in his lifetime. You could say \"But you are successful?\" i\u2019m successful in learning about the beauty that is afforded to rich people. But in learning that, being brought up, middle class, it\u2019s something that is beating out of my chest. \u2018Wait a second, I was middle class, and I didn\u2019t get to see none of this shit!\u2019\n\nLet\u2019s have an NBC telethon moment, and say that beauty has been stolen from the people and is being sold back to them under the concept of luxury!\n\nIt\u2019s illegal to not wear clothes, and also possibly too cold. That means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to do! Clothing should be like food. There should never be a $5000 sweater. You know what should cost $5000? A car should be $5000. And you know who should work on the car? The people that work on the $500,000 cars. All the best talent in the world needs to work for the people. And I am so fucking serious about this concept that I will stand in front of anyone and fight for it. Because I was 14 and middle class. I know what it felt like to not get what I have\n\nPeople say to me \u2018you\u2019re successful, what are you crying about?\u2019. I\u2019m crying about the people. I\u2019m crying about their daughters. Our daughters, as one family. What good is it? What good is anything that everyone can\u2019t have? Every ism. They think we\u2019re done with racism. What about elitism, what about separatism, what about classism?

friends' best advice was to stay low\nI guess it's hard to decipher all of the bills\nEspecially when you got family members on payroll\nThe media said it was outlandish spendin'\nThe media said he's way out of control\nI just feel like I'm the only one not pretendin'\nI'm not out of control, I'm just not in they control\nI know I'm the most influential\nThat TIME cover was just confirmation\nThis generation's closest thing to Einstein\nSo don't worry about me, I'm fine\nI can see a thousand years from now in real life\nSkate on the paradigm and shift it when I feel like\nTroll conventional thought, don't need to question\nI know it's antiquated so sometimes I get aggressive\nThank God for Jay Electra, he down with the mission\nDid it with no permission, on our own conditions\nMost blacks with money have been beaten to submission\nYeezy with the big house, did it way different\nNever listen to Hollywood producers\nDon't stare at money too long, it's Medusa\nThe ultimate Gemini has survived\nI wasn't supposed to make it past 25\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nOh, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nAnd you wonder where is God in your nightlife\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\n(Father, Father, Father in the night sky)\nWonderin' whether God's gonna say hi\nYeah, I feel like I'm home, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nI've been wakin' the spirits of millions more to come\nA million illegally downloaded my truth over the drums\nI believe in the children, listen to the kids, bro\nIf the phone ringin', go and get your kids, ho\nBrother Don Muhammad told the minister about the presentation\nHe sat back and smiled\nBlack on black lies is worse than black on black crime\nThe Jews share their truth on how to make a dime\nMost black men couldn't balance a checkbook\nBut buy a new car, talkin' 'bout \"how my neck look?\"\nWell, it all looks great\nFour hundred years later, we buyin' our own chains\nThe light is before us brothers, so the devil workin' hard\nReal family stick together and see through the mirage\nThe smokescreens, perceptions of false reality\nWho the real owner if your boss gets a salary?\nI am one with the people\nI am one with the people (real!)\nI've been woken from enlightened man's dream\nCheckin' Instagram comments to crowdsource my self-esteem\nLet me not say too much or do too much\nCause if I'm up way too much, I'm out of touch\nI'm prayin' a out-of-body experience will happen\nSo the people can see my light, now it's not just rappin'\nGod, I have humbled myself before the court\nDrop my ego and confidence was my last resort\nI know, I know He got a plan, I know I'm on Your beams\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I turned on the news and they was buryin' me\nOne set of footsteps, You was carryin' me\nWhen I was negotiatin' with Apple, it was Larry and me\nTold Tim Cook to call me, I was scary to see\nI would've took a hundred million and gave 20 to Hov\nI heard it's the way they did it when we only had a stove\nBut it's better that I stayed at home with my folks\nCause if Jay a billionaire then I'ma never go broke\nOnly thing I ask is next time I'm on stage we all go\nWe all go\nNot just by myself, lookin' for niggas like where's Waldo\nShe got the same shoes as my wife but she copped 'em at Aldo\nModern-day MJ, with a off-the-wall flow\n\n[Bridge: Sampha]\nNightlife, walk all over me\nWalk all over me\nI'm deliverin' everything I've ever sent that you'll bring\nFly, fly, fly overseas\nFly overseas\nOh, anywhere, everything but in between\nOh, yeah\n\n[Chorus: Sampha]\nYeah, you're lookin' at the church in the night sky\nWonderin'

sold\nI can't quite understand the games you play\nUnderstand, understand, understand I'm standin' under oath\nAnd I promised I, I wouldn't fall anymore\nBut I'm cryin' at the bar\nI'm wishin' that you saw my scars, man\nI'm wishin' that you came down here and stood by me\nAnd looked at me like you knew me\nBut I feel so alone\nLike I don't know anyone except the night sky above\n\n[Chorus:

easy go, how that saying goes\nNo more broad service, cars, and them TV shows\nI had all that snatched from me\nA&Rs and they faculties all turn their back on me\nAnd didn't want to hear a rap from me\nSo naturally actually had to face things factually\nHad to be a catastrophe with the fridges staring back at me\nCause nothing's there, nothing's fair\nI don't want to ever go back there\nSo I won't be taking no days off 'til my spaceship takes off\n\n[Hook]\nI've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit\nI wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky\nI've been workin'

I wanted to make sure for anyone that didn\u2019t have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show. So anybody who wants to come tonight, you can have tickets for the entire office!\n\nBut I just wanted to tell you guys: I really do believe that the world can be saved through design, and everything needs to actually be \u201carchitected.\u201d And this is the reason why even some of the first DONDA employees were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings. But just to see the work actually be actualized.\n\nIf I sit down and talk to Oprah for 2 hours, the conversation is about realization, self realization, and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you. So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews is because I\u2019ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way.\n\nAnd I know that there\u2019s more creativity to happen. And I know that there\u2019s traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there\u2019s people in offices that stop the creative people, and (who) are intimidated by actual good ideas.\n\nI believe that utopia is actually possible\u2014but we\u2019re led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political. So in no way am I a politician\u2014I\u2019m usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct. I really appreciate you guys\u2019 willingness to learn and hone your craft, and not be lazy about creation.\n\nI\u2019m very inspired to be in this space. Tonight, this show, if you come see it\u2014um, I\u2019m a bit self conscious because I\u2019m showing it to architects. So the stage does have flaws in it.

We talk about President Obama, but you forget some of the things that this man has said to really go against the grain and challenge thought, fearlessly. For example:\n\n[excerpts of Kanye]:\n\"George Bush doesn't care about black people.\"\n\n\"And another thing is, people so gay-conscious now. That's like the whole thing, like with the internet \u2014 every day, somebody's- \"Ooh I can tell he gay now!\" you know?

That's the homie, what else can I do?\n\n[Kanye West]:\nI don't even have to say anything, interview over. That's all, that's it\n\n[Sway]:\nGood to see you man! First and foremost, it's good to see you. I had a chance to go and see the Yeezus tour for the first time. I could not miss this tour with A Tribe Called Quest opening up at Madison Square Garden\n\nFirst of all, I really appreciate when artists like yourself put spotlight  on artists that influenced you. You know, artists that you grew up with, tuned in to, listening to, and that gave you inspiration like Tribe Called Quest. Is that why you put them on the bill?\n\n[Kanye]:\nYeah, I mean that's one of my biggest inspirations. Q-Tip is like my hero. MIDNIGHT MARAUDERS, \"Electric Relaxation,\" uh, uh, LOW END THEORY... a lot of the melodies that particularly Q-Tip \u2014 the type of chords they would sample, and that Pete Rock would sample, or like that were sampled on 93 'TIL INFINITY, which I felt was influenced by Tribe mostly... was, you know, what I was going for when I did THE COLLEGE DROPOUT. Or when I always felt  I was at my highest level was when I was closest to like, Tribe records. So, a record like \"Heard 'Em Say\" was a accomplishment for me, to have something that even sounded close to what they did\n\n[Sway]:\nYou know, I heard you speaking about other producers that are from that era, and I love when that happens, because I don't think we value our history a lot. You know, someone's going to speak on you. They already have started speaking on you. You've influenced a generation of artists who are now becoming more introverted, but more outspoken. Uh, more in tune with the different dimensions of what it is to be a person. Not just, you know, your persona, but speaking emotionally as well\n\nI heard you speak on Diamond D before, another classic producer. And then you also got Showbiz, from the Diggin' in the Crates Crew. What can you say about producers like Showbiz and Diamond D, and how they influenced you?\n\n[Kanye]:\nI mean, it was just, every time something new dropped, whether it was like SOUL CLAP or you know, just Diamond D being the best producer on the mic. And just, you know, me having these guys to look up to. And hearing the way their music sounded, and knowing that, you know, I didn't really have enough money to buy the records that were needed to create a sound to the level of what The Beatnuts were creating, and what Diamond D was creating\n\nAnd you know, you go through that a lot of times in your life, where exactly what you want to make, you might not have the exact resources for it at that time. Where No I.D. was the one dude that I knew that had all those drums in his basement, now Eric Schmidt is one of the guys that I know that has what I need in order to keep creating what I need to make DONDA the next\u2014 the best way I can say it is the post-internet Disney. But, it's more like Willy Wonka. Whatever idea I have, I want to bring it into fruition\n\nWilly Wonka didn't stop making chocolate because he was making other things. People wanna marginalize me from the top all the way to the bottom. Or, who's to say who's at the top or the bottom, you know what I'm saying? But it's people who just want to hear the music that are like, \"don't work on nothing else because we love your music so much, so don't do that.\" And there's people at the top that are like, \"look, just perform at my... son's bar mitzvah, don't do that.\"\n\nAnd what Dr. King said about racism was: even if you don't perform a racist act, if you turn your head to it, that's a form of racism\n\n[Sway]:\nThat's a form of racism\n\n[Kanye]:\nSo, as powerful as that is, is the way I'm trying to simplify and repeat to the public, to everyone involved, that that is what they are doing to me now. Because my demo tape is that Yeezus tour. So if you take that Yeezus tour, and you meet with Disney, or you meet with Zuckerberg, or you meet with Eric Schmidt, don't tell me I haven't written out the right plan for it. It's 20,000 people, 4 nights in a row looking at pure creativity\n\nSo if I say I got a film idea, the Yeezus tour is more of a film or Broadway or a play idea than it is a concert idea. Watch the Throne was a rap concert idea. I like working with Jay, because I can particularly get into the zone of high-level rap, and we brought that neo-Run DMC, you know, niggas in leather, luxe, chains, and everything, to the highest level. Now you see the NFL uses that same thing, bringing Tom Brady up on a cube, right? But would the NFL invest in DONDA to just come up with the ideas in the first place?\n\nLike, before there was even a Willow or the concept of it \u2014 basically, it's like if you ever saw Semi-Pro, and how like Will Ferrell was trying to start a new league? You know, DONDA is like the NBA of creativity. Willow is the guy who used to work for DONDA that now designs Jay's tours, Rihanna's tours, Justin's tours. But he's still one of my best friends, and one of my biggest inspirations, and also found a lot of the guys that work at DONDA currently, like Matt Williams who created Been Trill, and also had discovered Lady Gaga, put Gaga with Nick Knight and everything\n\nSo, right now, y'all watching almost a comedy of life right now. If you go see Semipro and see how this man was trying to get people to come to the show, he was the coach of the team, he'd have to play on the team sometimes. And that's what it is, it's like, where would Michael Jordan be with no NBA?\n\n[Sway]:\nCan I ask you a question? I have to cut you off, um, that sound familiar!\n\nWhat I got from\u2014 one of the things, if you go to Yeezus, if you go see this tour, which I encourage everyone to see because I've watched concerts my entire career, and I've never had an experience quite like that. Every song was it's own story, you know. On stage, it was\u2014 nothing was the same and you were totally committed to it. You even\u2014 when the lights were dim, you would call out in the middle of the song, \"Yo! The lights are too dim,\" or \"They're too bright!\" When it was too much smoke around the mountain, \"Yo, there's too much smoke! They can't get their Instagram pictures.\"\n\nIt was really fascinating to see you so in control of this whole experience. When I heard you tell a story about Lenny Kravitz trying to break into the world of fashion and Louis Vuitton and these guys giving you a shot, and Pharrell. And then turning their backs on you. In that  particular field, would you say that part of fashion, the fashion world is racist?\n\n[Kanye]:\nUh, I'd say classist and controlist. It's not racist, because they love Asians, you know, so it's not racism. It's more like who can they control? I mean, a guy that was sent to me from Puma literally came to me and said, \"How can we control you?\" But you can't control me, I'm gonna bring positivity to the world. You know, I'm Christian, I'm about to be married, I got a family, I'm not trying to do nothing but good. But Imma rattle that cage until you let me do it\n\nLike, I was interviewing with Charlemagne and he kept on coming up with these old slave concepts of like, you know, \"How you gonna work with the corporations, but you gonna dis the corporations?\" I'm saying, I'm just turn\u2014 I wanna be recognized! You don't think, like, half of Drake's songs was coming at me to the point where I had to show up on that stage with him? And then he's like, \"Okay, now you see me.\" And that's exactly what I'm doing, I'm like, man, y'all gon' SEE. ME. Y'all not gonna act like you don't see me because it's 50 paparazzi following me. So no like, Graydon Carter, Vanity Fair, no\u2014  it's no powers that could be that are on the internet, that control magazines, that control media, that can stop the movement. It's\u2014\n\n[Sway]:\nWhat I don't\u2014 like, I  had Buckshot from Duck Down here yesterday. He has a new sneaker called Triple Threat, and he couldn't break into the sneaker world, so he found his own partners, they got their own manufacturing. They starting to take it from the\u2014 they gonna start from the bottom and work they way up. You're Kanye West. All that stuff you said about Marc Jacobs and those guys and H&M stealing ideas...\n\n[Kanye]:\nWell, I was giving props to Marc Jacobs for actually letting 2 niggas in. And the thing is, he let 1 nigga in but he's the nice guy, that's Pharrell. He let another nigga in that almost lost his life, so I'm living in the afterlife, as far as I'm concerned. I'm living in the second life. I got heaven on earth right now, and Imma make sure that I find my joy, and I don't care about the stipulations of brands or names. People always talking about brands and names; I'm just talking about simplifying things, you know?\n\nEve made Adam bite the apple, and ever since then it's been illegal to be naked. I'm just trying to help people with they opinion on the law. I've had some clothing mishaps, I've had some clothing triumphs and stuff like that. But I know that I'm\u2014 the next Ralph, to say the least! Like, people are combinations of what they were in the past. So that means, of course I'm a combination of Martin and Malcolm, but I'm also a combination of Lenny and Michael, but I'm also a combination of Disney and this\u2014 we all combi\u2014 in the future, people will be absorbing all of what was, you know?\n\nThink about what the iPhone is currently, you woulda had to have 30 different things in your house to do what a iPhone does in 1. So, for people to say the idea that Kanye West should only do music, it's ridiculous! Like, people told me I shouldn't do music back when I was in art school!\n\n[Sway]:\nI'm sorry, I know our time is limited and I don't see you, so...\n\n[Kanye]:\nNo, I'll give you a little bit more time\n\n[Sway]:\nMan, I appreciate that, man! You gave me time, you gave me my first TV, it's all coming together\n\n(laughter)\n\n[excerpt of Kanye]:\n\"I gave Sway his first TV.\"\n\n(laughter)\n\n[Kanye]:\nLike, you just never had a TV ever before in your life!\n\n(laughter)\n\n[Sway]:\nThat was classic though, man, that was classic. Uh, but why is it that you need these people? Like you said, you don't need anybody to do these things. You don't need Adidas if you want to do a new shoe\n\n[Kanye]:\nYes, you do\n\n[Sway]:\nWhy?\n\n[Kanye]:\nBecause you need proper production to bring something that has a certain value. I mean, put it like this: like, if I want to get this uh, Japanese-level thermal, right, at a better price to you, if I'm starting small, I'm not gonna be able to get the best price, and I'm gonna be losing money to the point where I can't afford it. I went $13 million in debt working on my clothing line and I'm getting Kanye West-ed constantly with the prices, everywhere I go. So that means, that if someone got less money than me, they charging me a bunch more, because they look at me as the money. That's something they do\u2014 they take these celebrities, and they show you this fabulous life of non-billionaires\n\n(Kanye stutters)... I'm talking about, it's\u2014 maybe it's like 20 hot celebrities a year; it's 1,470 billionaires. Those 20 hot celebrities, if they were billionaires, they could make sure they're celebrities forever. But they be outta there\u2014  they get the wrong hit, they get in trouble, they do this, they lose this contract, blah blah blah, they outta control, all that...\n\nOne thing\u2014 I was out in Italy, even right now, uh, trying to start my own company. The type of people that work with musicians... for the most part it's VERY difficult to get high-end, respected fashion people to work with someone that's considered to be a musician. It's very hard to get the good people. Because tell me this\u2014 if someone was a fashion designer and came to Dr. Dre, would Dr. Dre produce for them? It's hard! It's just as hard as it was bringing Mos Def to the studio with Jay-Z. Now it's like, and\u2014  that's what THE COLLEGE DROPOUT was, it was the combination of those things\n\nBut, let's thank Adidas for giving me the opportunity, it wasn't that Nike didn't uh, you know, offer me a contract. It still was extremely marginalized and a slap in my face, you know what I'm saying? Because they let me design, you know, it's like, yeah, they did me a favor by letting me design, but they let other people ... they let Pharrell design, they let Eminem design, I just designed the Yeezys. I turnt up, where they didn't think I could turn up that far. And they tried to hold it back!\n\nIt was like, it was like that moment, you know, when I thought about taking Nicki's verse off of \"Monster\" because I knew people would say that was the best verse on the best Hip-Hop album of all time, or arguably top 10 albums of all time, right? And I would do all that work, 8 months of work on DARK FANTASY, and people, to this day will say to me, \"Aw, my favorite thing is Nicki Minaj verse!\"\n\nSo if I let me ego get the best of me, instead of letting that girl get the shot to get that platform and become all she could be, I would take it off or marginalize her, try to stop her from having that shining moment\n\nSo what happens when Mark Parker's riding on his jet? When somebody come up to him and say, \"My son's favorite shoes is the Yeezy.\" Now they could've been working on the Flyknit for 5 years, and working on this project, blah blah\u2014 but what I was doing, was so disruptive, as disruptive as that Nicki Minaj \"Monster\" verse was, is how disruptive the Yeezys were. People hadn't felt that feeling since the Jordans. And by the way\u2014 the Jordans, only popular at this point because of two people: me and Don C. Because Don C was ordering them vintage Jordans when the 4s used to break apart, on the sole? And we was wearing them\u2014  back when I was wearing the Louis Vuitton backpack with the polos? And they, Jordan looked at, the brand Jordan looked at us and said, \"Oh man, we gotta start retro-ing them.\" Because when you think of Jordans, what you think of? You don't even know what the new Jordans look like. All you think about is them retros\n\n[Sway]:\nWhat's going to happen with the Red Octobers?\n\n[Kanye]:\nYou know Nike told me when I asked them? \"We ain't sure.\" You know what they told the store though, of my\u2014 of my boy that run a store? They said \"if y'all want that Red October, you gotta take these 10 other shoes.\" So they told me, they ain't sure, but then they told them, if you want that Red October\u2014 but legally, we gotta both sign that contract, Mark Parker. Imma put Mark Parker all on that Summer Jam screen. And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will still accept an investment in DONDA. I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes\n\nBut if you guys that are investing in the arts, y'all want to invest in this school in Brazil, y'all wanna go to Africa, I'm standing up and I'm telling you, I am Warhol! I. Am. The number one most impactful artist of our generation! I am Shakespeare, in the flesh! Walt Disney. Nike. Google. Now who's gonna be the Medici family and stand up and let me create more? Or do you wanna marginalize me 'til I'm out of my moment?\n\n[Sway]:\nBut why don't you empower yourself and don't need them and do it yourself?\n\n[Kanye]:\nHow, Sway!?\n\n[Sway]:\nTake a few steps back, to go\u2014\n\n[Kanye (Sway)]:\nYou ain't got the answers man! You ain't got the answers! (Kanye) You ain't got the answers!  You ain't got the answers, Sway! (Kanye) I been doing this more than you! (Doing what more than me?) You ain't got\u2014 (C'mon, chill out, bro!) You ain't got the answers! (Kanye, relax!) You ain't got the answers! (Bro, rela\u2014 I'm asking you a question!) You ain't been doing the education. (Bro!) You ain't been doing the education! (Kanye, calm down!) You don't have the answers though. (Calm down!) Because you trying to give me advice about something- (No! No no no no, listen) You ain't- You ain't got the answers! You ain't spend 13 million dollars of your own money trying to empower yourself!\n\n[Sway]:\nKanye, you're absolutely right, but I've spent hundreds of thousands putting out clothing lines at a smaller degree. All I'm asking you\u2014\n\n[Kanye]:\nAnd it ain't no Ralph, though! It ain't Ralph level\n\n[Sway]:\nOkay well let me ask you this, I'm asking\u2014\n\n[Kanye]:\nWhat's the name of your clothing line? We don't know, you know what I'm saying?\n\n[Sway]:\nKanye! Because I lost money, but that's not\u2014\n\n[Kanye (Sway)]:\nExactly, and I could lose money on a higher level, too! Don't think just because\u2014 (And that's what I'm asking you\u2014 ) Don't think just because I got the most, or the least money (Wait, hold up, let me finish my question, dog) Man be\u2014 no, man! (Or hear the question, man) You don't have the answers\u2014\n\n[Sway]:\nI'm asking you for the answer, it's a question! Why is it that you can't? You have money, you have\u2014\n\n[Kanye]:\nI just told you, I lost the money because I did not have the knowledge of how to do it the right way\u2014\n\n[Sway]:\nOkay, so you don't have money. So you don't have the money to do it! That's your answer! You ain't gotta turn up, man. This ain't no fucking... show, man. I'm talking to you as a homie!\n\n[Kanye (Sway)]:\nIt ain't no homie, man, because\u2014 the thing is, the bottom line is\u2014 (Man, all I'm saying... ) Everybody, every\u2014 (you ain't gotta turn up like\u2014 ) All you\u2014 (You ain't gotta\u2014 Hold, hold up! Ay man, listen bro) Ain't no hold up! (It don't gotta be no hold up! I'm asking you a question!) Ain't no hold up! (I'm asking you a question!) Ain't no hold up!\n\n[Sway]:\nWhat you mean \"it ain't no hold up\"? Man, we here talking as civilized people. I'm trying to understand your world, because when I go to your concert, I'm curious about what you're saying! I don't know! That's why I'm asking you the questions\n\n[Kanye]:\nWell Imma explain to you what it is\n\n[Sway]:\nOk, but you ain't gotta turn up on me, man to man, dog? Fuck these mics, we could turn all this shit off, you ain't gotta do this, it's cool. I love you, bro. But you ain't gotta turn up. Ain't no\u2014 don't try to embarrass us\n\n[Kanye]:\nI'm not trying to embarrass y'all, what I'm tryna say to y'all is: this industry, of what I'm trying to get into, ain't nobody never broke down! Ain't nobody broke down! We all slaves! So I ain't tryna disrespect you and your show. We all slaves to something\u2014\n\n[Sway]:\nIt ain't about my show, 'Ye\u2014\n\n[Kanye]:\nI ain't tryna disrespect you, period! Let me talk, if you gonna have me talk. We all slaves! We all slaves! And y'all ain't experience nothing right here but a moment from a movie out of Glory. Back in the day, if slaves had enough money they could buy they own freedom. We all slaves\u2014 we slaves to Nike, we slaves to Benz, we slaves to public perception. We slaves to not looking, you know, what somebody gonna say after the interview: \"Why you let Kanye do that? you should've checked him.\"\n\n[Sway]:\nI don't give a\u2014\n\n[Kanye]:\nI love you man, I'm sorry! I love you man, I'm sorry, ok?\n\n[Sway]:\nOk, that's fine, that's fine\n\n[Kanye]:\nBut look at this, this exactly what would happen at the French Revolution, this exactly what happened\u2014 I'm sure there's some arguments with Harriet Tubman and other people, talking about \"Let's go this way,\" \"Let's go that way.\" But what I'm trying to say is: I sat in Paris. And met with these people. I invested my own money. And lost money. I made T-shirts that made money! I made music that made money. But at the end of the day, Lucian Grainge still cut my music checks\n\nAs powerful as my voice is, Lucian still runs 50 percent of the music industry. Fran\u00e7ois Pinault owns Balenciaga, Puma, St. Laurent, Stella McCartney. Fran\u00e7ois [ed: Bernard] Arnault owns Louis Vuitton, um, C\u00e9line, Givenchy. Renzo Rosso owns Margiela, Diesel, Marni, Viktor & Rolf. These guys got factories! These guys have factories. They run that!\n\nThe thing\u2014 the thing that compresses me is time versus money. Integrity, money, and relevance. Because, as I work on clothing more, I'm not rapping as much. So I'm not in the middle of that Future mix because I ain't do that feature. I'm not rapping as much, I'm not having as much finances. I'm losing relevancy. The relevancy is part of my power that allows my brand to be big. That's what I'm saying, you juggle so crazy!\n\nBut then you get a Nike, that could simply say: \"The Yeezys did good, that was a good job. Let me get you some more so you can start your own line, because obviously people lining up for it.\" But they'll marginalize you, and play you, and talk about, \"We don't even know when the Red Octobers coming out.\" You see what I'm saying? I'm juggling a lot of things at the same time. You know what I'm saying like, y'all putting me number 6 after Big Sean on the Hip-Hop list!\n\n[Sway]:\nMan, do you really give a\u2014\n\n[Kanye]:\nMy\u2014 no, what I'm saying is, my relevancy\u2014 that means because, because I'm wearing a kilt or because I'm doing something that's game-y...\n\n[Sway]:\nNaw, that ain't why you was number 6. At the time we did the show\u2014\n\n[Kanye]:\nWhat you think now, though? What you think now?\n\n[Sway]:\nIf we did it now, you would be number 1! You or Drake, it would be between your or Drake who would be number 1. That's what I say now. Who would you think would be number 1? Out of you and Drake?\n\n[Kanye]:\nDrake?\n\n[Sway]:\nDrake\n\n[Kanye]:\nYeah\n\n[Sway]:\nThat's what I think now. At the time we did the list, you had the CRUEL SUMMER album, and you had the \"Mercy\" song, you didn't have \"New Slaves\" out\n\n[Kanye]:\nI don't care about the list\u2014\n\n[Sway]:\nBut I do! Because you've been going around discrediting the list. And the people who do the list, there's not another collective of people in this business that know more about Hip-Hop. These are the same people who said you were number 1 years ago!\n\n[Kanye]:\nNo, it's fine, the list is fine. But what I'm trying to say is when you trying to keep up with the list, and write all these raps, but you also trying to learn about clothing. You got a whole hood calling you a fag for even liking clothes, for being at like, uh the runway shows. Like you can't be a masculine person like Ralph Lauren, and still love the beauty and texture of clothing, as a artist. And still love a fat ass at the same time. You know?\n\nThen you got America, the president, constantly attacking you. Then you got people over-charging you at all times. Then you got your constant public perception being brought down. AEG telling you when you go on tour, when you can't tour. Everybody got opinion towards you. You got shoes like the Nikes selling at eighty thousand dollars, and the the head won't even get on the phone with you. You got a meeting where every single door gets closed on you, like the Will Smith movie with his son, it's like that. It's like that, but me! But me, because I'm in that Michael Jackson position where he couldn't get his video played on MTV because he was considered to be \"urban.\"\n\n[Sway]:\nSo...what is your plan\u2014\n\n[Kanye]:\nAnd sidebar, you gotta get in\u2014 you gotta...Charlemagne wanted this so bad! He wanted me to turn up so bad, I wouldn't even look at him. See, I can turn up around you because I love you, as my brother, we got history. Me and Charlemagne, we turn up, we don't know what\u2014 we don't know where that's gonna go. I know that we gonna hug it out, everything is cool\n\n[Sway]:\nYeah yeah, we're good money. But we haven't talked in a while and so\u2014 and what you go through...by the way, I am always in your corner. And you're, you're right. You're in a realm where we don't know, people don't know what you're experiencing. Man, all these fucking names you naming sound foreign to me, bro. Because we don't know. But we need you to explain it, if I ask you a question man you can't blow up on it. I'm trying to understand why can't you? I don't understand. Now I do. I don't understand why you need these people to get your music out, you got the internet. You king of the internet. When you did your uh, GOOD Fridays, that was fucking\u2014 nobody did nothing like that. Why you need those people is what I don't understand. But you explained it to me. That's a fair question. Let's talk about your music real quick, though. Alright...\n\n[Woman 1]:\nYes, boy, my drink is running out, too, Sway, goodness\n\n[Sway]:\nFirst of all, the YEEZUS album is incredible to me. You know, there's a lot of messaging that I like. Sonically, it was different. It reminded me of a time we were on the road talking to veterans and I asked you about music, and you said \"I don't use sounds.\" I said, \"How you pickin' your sounds?\" You said, \"I don't see music as sounds, I see it as colors.\" You know, so when  listen to your music, that's what I do. I see it as colors\n\nTwo things: I'm curious to why Pusha T and Big Sean weren't on this tour, with the GOOD Music artists. Why did you decide not to put them on the tour?\n\n[Kanye]:\nWell, every artist that makes good music, is on GOOD Music. Drake on GOOD Music. Wayne on GOOD Music. James Blake on GOOD Music, Frank Ocean on GOOD Music. You make good music, you on GOOD Music in my mind. I'm not marginalized by the brand of the deal that I've taken from Universal in order to cut some of my homeboys some checks so that we can, you know, work on creative projects together. I'm not marginalized by the branding concept of GOOD Music versus Cash Money. All I do text Baby like, \"Yo we need to do something together.\" You know what I'm sayin'? We not each other's enemies\n\nAnd everybody got to get they own, you know, maybe it's just a piano that I'm bringing for John Legend, executive produced that. Maybe it's a art package that I do for Pusha, or beg him to take like, a certain song off that I think sound too commercial. You know, because we didn't quite get to that with Big Sean on some of the songs that I wanted to take off and stuff. And it upset me as a Hip-Hop artist a bit. And now he gonna turn up on this next one and we talked it out and everything, and that's what it's gonna be\n\nBut I think that, for me, I serve as an inspiration. We do go hard, I feel like \"Started from the Bottom\" now we here is Drake rapping harder because we pushing harder. We pushing each other like, when Jadakiss and Styles was spitting, we had to push each other\n\nAnd what I'm establishing with YEEZUS is, you know, to take that stance, and I put my whole family on my back and I say \"Fuck the radio,\" as that number one most important artist of our generation to say that. And, I'm saying \"Fuck the radio\" not saying I don't want to be played on the radio. But it's just saying stop making songs for the radio, make songs for the people! And then some people could say \"Well, man I don't feel like YEEZUS was for the people. I don't feel like blah blah blah.\" Or make songs for yourself, you know what I'm saying? Because for me, I like \"On Sight.\" I like all the songs, that's the shit that's enjoyable for me to listen to after I'm\u2014\n\nBecause when I was in Paris, man, I worked on that album\u2014 my mama nicknamed me Mandela when I was a shorty.  I wanted to burn those buildings down... it's a misconception that I said \"Boycott Louis Vuitton.\" You can't boy\u2014 I wouldn't say\u2014 I wouldn't tell nobody to boycott a brand that ain't nobody even thinking about no more! Nobody thinking about buying Louis Vuitton! That brand old! You know what I'm saying? Nobody thinking about that brand, I wouldn't say boycott that brand!\n\nI'm talking about some relevancy. But I wanted to go in and turn\u2014 and let me tell you something else that's so Hip-Hop. The music and the clothing are just as important! That's what make you Hip-Hop! You show people that you Hip-Hop by what you wear. So if I was able to be considered a person that wasn't *allowed* to be Hip-Hop, wasn't allowed to be a rapper, and I went and turned around and became the most important, not rapper, but artist of the past 10 years?! That's exactly what Imma do\n\nAnd I'm gonna be the first, straight, Hip-Hop, loud, celebrity, non-etiquette having, black out all the time, fresh-ass, super tasteful designer! Of all time! Imma be the 2Pac of clothing! You can't be a bigger music superstar than Michael Jackson. You can't be a bigger basketball star than Michael Jordan. You can't be a bigger rapper than 2Pac. But it's a space, and it's product territory, to Steve Jobs that all the way\n\n[Sway]:\nCan I? Okay, and I respect that, and I think that's what makes you great. That's what makes you an inspiration\u2014 you're fearless, ok? And we need that in Hip-Hop. I've seen that with 'Pac, I see that with you, I've seen that with Jay. I see that with Drake, in the way he makes his music. People critique him, but he going through similar things you went through. But he's fearless. But at the end of the day, too, at the core of all this, what made me like you in the first place? Is that you're talented, and you know how to rap well. So, all this shit started with rap, bro. And my second question is...\n\n[Kanye]:\nUh, that's your opinion. That's not my opinion\n\n[Sway]:\nFor me. I'm talking about for me\n\n[Kanye]:\nI started from my mama, now I'm here.

You're not the same person\n\n[Kanye]:\nYeah, in a way, but I've been the same person since age zero. I was born to be me\n\n[Sway]:\nOk, ok. Hey man, can you do a rap for us? Can you rap for us, bro?! Can I get a verse?\n\n[Kanye]:\nI ain't got no new verse\n\n[Sway]:\nYou ain't got no new verse?\n\n[Kanye]:\nI ain't got no new verse\n\n[Sway]:\nMan, last time we talked, you came off the top of the head.

Thank you, man. That's a wrap? That's what you gonna leave us with?\n\n[Kanye]:\nYeah, that was the first freestyle that had absolutely no rhymes\n\n[Sway]:\nThat's what you gonna leave us with, right?\n\n[Kanye]:\nYeah\n\n[Sway]:\nThat's it, huh?\n\n[Kanye]:\nYeah\n\n(laughter)\n\n[Sway]:\nThat's...word?\n\n[Kanye]:\nThat's it\n\n[Sway]:\nThat's it, huh?

For example:\n\n[Kanye West]: George Bush doesn't care about black people\n\n[Kanye West]: And another thing is, people are so gay-conscious now. That's like the whole thing like with the Internet \u2014 every day, somebody's- \"Ooh I can tell he gay now!\" you know, but back in the day, people used to have songs like \"Get In That Ass\" or something like that\n\n[Kanye West]: Remind me who's the original superfly, and I got love for Hov but I ain't fucking with that Suit and Tie\n\n[Sway]: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome for the first time to Sway in the Morning here at Shade 45: the one, the only, the incomparable, Kanye West!\n[Sway]: What's is going to happen with the Red Octobers?\n\n[Kanye West]: You know Nike told me when I asked them? \"We ain't sure.\" You know what they told the store though, of my- of my boy that run the store?

I'mma put Mark Parker all on that Summer Jam screen. And by the way, Mark Parker, yes I will still accept an investment in Donda. I got some more ideas that don't involve shoes.

Have dealt with in their life somehow, you know, being ridiculed for liking fashion. For that being a career you want to take up. Like even with the stylist that I work with that\u2019s my.. I always call her my baby of M.A.S. [?]. \u201cYou\u2019re my M.A.S. and I\u2019m your Nicholas.\u201d And her brother\u2019s a doctor. And somehow in her family she\u2019s looked at like she didn\u2019t do as much  in her life \u2018cause she did fashion and something. You know, and, she was the little girl that eight years ago showed me who Emmanuelle Alt was. Back when I was, you know, less informed about how to put my shit together\n\nAnd I honest.. I\u2019mma jump to a point just so I don\u2019t take too long. I believe that the world can be changed. The world can be saved through design. Through unselfish design. Through unselfish creation. You know, God is the number one creator. I\u2019m a Christian, I\u2019m not tryna push my opinions on anyone. But in my opinion God is the number one creator. And we, anytime we, you know, create, we\u2019re extension of doing his work on Earth. While we\u2019re here what can we do for humanity? And, you know, in a way, the fashion is what defines the time. People could think in some way they\u2019re higher classes, some higher statuses that contribute more to the world because, you know, they work on bombs, they work at technology, they, you know, they school teachers. Whatever it is that seems to be somehow that type of profession that when you say it everybody is, \u201coh, you\u2019re a lawyer? Oh great.. lawyer? Motherfucker.\u201d No knock to lawyers, but you know what I\u2019m talking about. So there are no movies without fashion. We define the times, we set in stone. What did 2015 mean? What did 2014 mean? You know? I always told Anna - \u201cI wanna be in the middle of that conversation.\u201d As we all know, The Devil Wears Prada was about Anna .. I said, \u201cI wanna be in the middle of that conversation.\u201d Nah, I\u2019m saying.. we know this. So, where.. she was talking about the blue sweater. And previous to Instagram and all that type of shit do you know this conversation, \u201cyou think you not part of fashion because you don\u2019t datatata.\u201d Like the blue sweater, okay, you would know this. And somehow like me and my crew, you know, like all these straight, black guys from Chicago that no one knew why they were at the fucking show. You know, wanted to say, let\u2019s make the conversation, you know, let\u2019s make the conversation shorter between, you know, when the blue sweater goes from a Wang show to when it finally hit Kohl\u2019s\u2019 or something. Pre-Instagram, pre all that shit, pre people, you know, wanted to show what they had, before images were the new currency\n\nWhen we talk about, you know, I was talking to Rassi earlier and he was saying, you know, what his background was and you know, the way he appreciated all of his opportunities that he has like, to just being in America and being able to create. And I told him he had to arm wrestle with Virgil on like who is the greatest guy that I knew \u2018cause he\u2019s definitely one of the top. You know, one of these times when I look at like him and say \u201cwow,\u201d you know, I wish I could interact with people in the way that he interacts. I wish that I could believe in people unselfishly without, you know, worrying about how it may affect me, affects my reputation blabla, or all of what fashion is. Because I think that\u2019s word fashion insiders, but everyone\u2019s a fashion insider, you know. It\u2019s illegal to be naked, everyone has some form of fashion, every single day. And I think it\u2019s, the point I wanna make before I bring \u2018em up, because I wanted to make this point to this room really.. you know, we have the power to change the world. I believe that through design \u2018cause design is the closest to truth. Problem solving, truth is the closest to love, love is the closest thing to God and God is love. But we have to be unselfish in our approach which is the opposite of someone saying, \u201cKanye you can\u2019t get in this show \u2018cause you\u2019re a celebrity\u201d or some shit like that. You know, the way we embrace celebrity, the way, what Miley\u2019s had to go through in the past couple years. Dealing with the fashion bigots and shit like that. I\u2019m not gonna give you guys the speech that Tarantino gave at the Lacma, I\u2019mma say what the fuck he should\u2019ve really said, you know. The old guard accepting the new guard by letting down their guard. I don\u2019t even know if I made one fucking good point\n\nBut what I wanna say is, this guy let me, a celebrity designer, work at Milk Studio when Adidas couldn\u2019t figure out where my office was. We didn\u2019t have windows, you know, it was cool, you know. We\u2019d go out and get a cup of coffee, we stole a bunch of free cappuccinos from down the hallway. And I promised him that I was gonna be fucking good. It wasn\u2019t about me being a celebrity \u2018cause it could\u2019ve been like, \u201cwhat do you mean you got a celebrity designer working at Milk Studio? This is very authentic, blablabla..\u201d All the shit. And he told me a story about this kid who stood on his steps and shit, you know, waiting for opportunities to design then went onto one day become the youngest American to run a French house called Balenciaga. That he believed in that kid back then, believing in, spending everything on Alexander Wang. And, I\u2019m closing now. I don\u2019t move, I don\u2019t leave my fucking crib unless I really believe in someone. I don\u2019t read the teleprompters blablabla. And I\u2019m so happy that Jeremy is here \u2018cause Jeremy asked me to come here also and Jeremy is another one of those bad motherfuckers that changed the game and always expressed himself. I\u2019m not gonna say shit else. So all I\u2019mma say is, I fucking love this guy and he sets an example to us as a humanitarian, as a visionary and as an innovator: Rassi", "year": null}, {"artist": "Kanye West", "album": null, "title": "The Ellen Show: On Having More Kids", "lyrics": "Ellen: How do you think marriage has changed you, if it has?\n\nKanye: I've definitely learned how to compromise more. Which is something you have to understand when you partner with people in business. You know, you can't--\n\nEllen: Beautiful\n\nKanye: And I've learned how to shut up more and, um, I've--yeah. I think--I think I'm a better human being, you know, because of her\nAnd because of my daughter. And I have, you know, always someone to think about going home to and, you know, something for me to, you know, not only be brave for what I wanna do for humanity but also to be more protective of myself for my family too. Cause there's things I've done in the past that were considered negative, but I was really, you know, jumping in front of the tank for other people or for culture in a way. So now I always have to have that in my mind, that I have, like, a family that I have to protect too\n\nEllen: Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I do see that change in you. I see you-- And you are calmer, I think. You know, you don't seem, like, uh... like, uh...angry or--you know? You know what I mean? And I don't know if it was even anger, but it was just the way that you were getting all of your emotions out. And now I think your emotions\nAre grounded in a way that they come out in what you said and protection and love, and--and--they're going-- they're channeled\nIn a different way\n\nKanye: I think I was, like, going through now, like, my version of my terrible twos. My--my daughter, she wants to express herself, but she just doesn't have the words for it. And for me, there's so many things I wanna do with film, with clothing, and I just didn't have the words or the resources or the backing or the perception that I could do it, being that I was a rapper or, you know, all these things. And now, because of this Adidas deal, they allowed me a little bit of oxygen. Because what you have to understand-- The difference between, you know, what people give you about celebrity, the idea of money versus creativity. There's no amount of money that someone can give you to make you not be creative, if you were born to create. So a lot of times people try to block you, block your creativity, control you with money. And Adidas allowed me to make my whole clothing line, which I wanted to do, and it was just like a little bit of oxygen. You guys last year, two years ago, three--whatever. You guys were seeing someone being suffocated by a perception. Being suffocated by people in a position that could\nBlatantly see like, \"Wow, the \"Yeezys\" did really good. He was this influential. All those albums did this. But we're not gonna give him\nA shot in something else.\"  And there's a lot of people who, like, were really calm about that.

forth to work\nCause, you know, in the hood, the best paying job ain't always next to yo house, it's not within walking distance ('til it get sky high)\nSo you have to take 20 buses to get back and forth\nYou have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation\nThen you get paid on the job\nSo, maybe they might buy a car,  maybe they might buy shoes for their kids, you know\nAnd the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that\nI mean, like I said, I don't condone it, but I definitely got hugs for my thugs, you know\nTryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that I can ask is\nOnce they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it\nThat they try to bring their kids to school\nThat they try to make a

What was his Def Jam shit that they were doing?\" Because I remember like Ricky would say, \"When we did Def Jam, we wasn't really feelin' like we was in competition with nobody, cause this shit was so direct.\" Where we at right now? We in the middle of the city right now, over into the motherfuckin' streets and nobody shuttin' down shit while we makin' real music and yall vibin out to this shit.. So it's good for me to go to the God, Rick Rubin, and play him my shit. Ask him questions and allow him to take this project to an entirely new level and he made a lot of great decisions at the end and brought it to a whole new level.
