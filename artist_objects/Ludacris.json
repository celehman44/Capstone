light sometimes my vision gets blurred\nIt's all a part of growin up and seein life at it's worst\nThen tryin to iron out my wrinkles, puttin family first\nIt seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat\nBut with God as my navigator I'll be stayin afloat\nAnd I admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions\nThen I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions\nI'm battlin with MYSELF and every DAY it's a war\nCuriosity killed the cat, why I'm Curious George?\nGotta keep my nose up outta thangs that ain't none of my biz\nAnd just cause somethin looks good don't really mean that it is\nGet through the agony and anger, the pain and strife\nAnd take the necessary steps to try to change my life\nI got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood\nSo why is

child, so excuse some of my selfish ways\nI got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today\nOh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it\nIs from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin\nDodgin and duckin everybody tryin to hammer me down\nA self-made millionaire, baby look at me now\nCan't tell me nothin still hungry as the day I began\nCause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand\nAnd a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact\nMe and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that\nWas a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12\nTryin to get in where I fit, streets givin me hell\nBut yet I give it right - back, so how you like - that\nContinue doin wrong 'til I was on the right - track\nTell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a PUSH\nBut a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\nCome on\n\n[Hook: Nate Dogg]\nIt's gonna get in ya, child of the night\n(baby I got) and the hood rolls on\nHow do I begin to, do this shit right\n(baby I got)

cuttin edge, takin a stab at it\nAnd learnin from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice\nJust admittin when I'm wrong, tryin hard to make it right\nAnd baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours\nThere's plenty people gettin stitches in this world of scars\nBut over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds\nTry to love and love again until they seal your tomb\nCause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by\nThat's why my head is in the clouds tryin to pass the sky\nNever blinkin for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes\nThey wanna catch me in the open, bring my life to a close\nMeanwhile that's why I'm bringin so much life to my shows\nI've seen smiles I'm makin changes turnin glitter to gold\nDon't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul\nJust be

reaching for the light\nAvoid useless conflict while never running from the fight\nThe struggle that forever bubbles just beneath the surface\nI'm dedicating to the service of self and to my people\nAnd to never feeding the beast of unnecessary evil\nWe say the most when saying the least\nTaking action to display our character\nFrom the first second that we start to feast until the day that we break this barrier\nSo disparaging is the civilized savage relegated to antiquation only striving to become average\nI'm much happier as a maverick\nA cowboy that uses his cabbage to get more green than most niggas done seen\nThe good kind and never the bad bitch\nThe best that life has to give are the blessings of this life that we live\nAnd everyday on everyplace [trying] not lose my
