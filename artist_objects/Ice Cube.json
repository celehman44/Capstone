you're nuttin but a mark\nMake sure that you're in before dark\nBut if you need some affection, mate\nMake sure the bitch ain't a Section 8\nCause if so that's a monkey-wrench ho\nAnd you won't survive in South Central\n\n[Break]\nNow you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be\nYou realize that it's fucked up!\nIt ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV\nPalm trees and blonde

The only difference between it and South-Africa: South-Africa preaches separation and practices separation; America preaches integration and practices segregation. This is the only difference. They don't practice what they preach, whereas South-Africa preaches and practices the same thing.

I think that all people have been mistreated in some form or another, but I don't agree with him; I don't follow Muhammad. I don't think anyone should follow one man; I think they should follow their own conscience. I think the main problem of most negroes is that they feel sorry for themselves, and I think this keeps them back much more than they would be if they didn't feel so sorry for themselves\n\n[Malcolm X]\nIf Martin Luther King, Roy Wilkins or any of these compromising negroes who say exactly what the white man wants to hear is interviewed anywhere in the country, you don't get anybody to offset what they say.

This is natural, but it is done\n\n[Louis Farrakhan]\nYou know what I think? I just think you've given up. (Given up on what?)
