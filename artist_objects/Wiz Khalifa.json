All-Stars and smoke papers\nIPhone with no ringtones\nVibrate or on plane mode\nPalm trees, and bomb pre-rolled\nThe weed burning, but the money just fold\nWhile I'm looking at you niggas face\nLight another L, and pull the liquor out the case\nNiggas try and fail, see me, now they wanna hate\nFly another plane, a different city, 'nother state\nMy cash change the forecast\nAs a teen was half-baked

don't want the goonies in the riddle, let a cartridge squeeze\nYou niggas think you low, but i see you guys pop up\nMake your team divide like a piece of pie\nWhy? Cuz' i keep it fly, fresh when I'm creepin' by\nGot a mean team, but for me, I'm a peaceful guy\nBut don't get out of line, cuz' for them dollar signs\nThe full clip, will make a nigga's thoughts sit out his mind\n\nChorus - (Wiz Khalifa)\nIf it's on and poppin', go ahead and move somethin'\nAnd if a hater trip, go ahead and do somethin'\nIf it's on your chest, go ahead and prove somethin'\nIf not, stop frontin', you niggas ain't hurtin' nothin', no (X2)", "year": null}, {"artist": "Wiz Khalifa", "album": null, "title": "Dot Dot Dot", "lyrics": "[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]\nYeah nigga\nThis them weed raps y'all was talking about\nAye, turn my headphones up\nI'm talking straight shit\nI got money now motherfucker\nI had money then but this real money bitch\nHahahah, ohh\n\n[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]\nKing size papers, king size bed\nNiggas blow money but I'd rather keep mine instead\nRoll something nigga, blow something\nSay you're ballin out of control, let a nigga hold something\nSpecially if you got it and he don't put his niggas on\nTell me what's the sense of even having it fo'\nCause when you're broke, you'll have everything to gain\nWhen you lose it all, let you inhale out the vape\nDo it for the taste\nUsually I roll one up to pass around\nBut now I'm smokin' to the face\nCause chiefing with niggas is such a waste\nUnless they my niggas, and 9 times out of 10\nThey got their own pound with them\nOwn pack of papers and filters, something to grind\nWe be smoking them things like 6 at a time\n5 in the air, 4 breakin' down, 3 in my head, 2 on my mind, nigga\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nOne rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nI keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nOne rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nI keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nI keep more than\n\n[Verse 2: Curren$y]\nA bit of a pothead, it has been said\nI keep one rolled up like LL's pantsleg\nFull of life in this bitch, though I may seem half-dead\nTrust me, I'm cool, I just ain't talking to you\nAnd them checks coming through as just as I predicted\nGot a bigger portion\nCause the Jets eating off bigger dishes now\nAin't I the biggest fish up in this pond\nSince life's a bitch, tell her roll my shit up huh\nSecret compartment in my car, James Bond\nThough I'm James Bong, nigga bread long\nAnd my name known in e'ry home household\nCaught them pussies slippin' tryna squeeze\nIn the mouse hole, that cheese is \"nachos\"\nYou are not chose by the gods\nTo live as we do, so play your role in the movie\nAin't no pause, no rewind for no man, wait time\nSo I ain't wasting mine, more grass, more green, more grind\nNigga I keep\n\n[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]\nOne rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nI keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nOne rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nI keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled\nI keep more than\n\n[Verse 3: Big Sean]\nAnd these bitch ass niggas\nFuck around, might have to bitch-smack me a nigga\nRoll around with a bunch of get-rich ass niggas\nWho the man?
