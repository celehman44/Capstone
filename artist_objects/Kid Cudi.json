Talk)", "lyrics": "Look at that handsome face!\n\nUhh! Okay. Just wanna check the mic first (?) get the sound right. This is not comedy hour, I promise.\n\nThe funny thing is: I used to go to this school. And my class used to sit like in this area, here. Yeah, O2, who\u2019s an O2er?\n\nKendra, come here! Kendra, come on! Kendra (?) everybody! Come, give me a hug! I mean, how long has it been, two decades? Come up here! I was at all doing me. (?). How about that \u2013 reunion!\n\nOkay. So, it\u2019s just a little surreal, I haven\u2019t been in this room since 1999, 2000 maybe. So, I\u2019m 31, I just turned 31 on January 30th, how about that? Oh, thank you, thank you.\n\nAnd, when I was approached to do this Ted Talk, I was immediately like: Why? And, then it was kinda like, put in perspective by me, in \u2013 I\u2019m not really one to do speeches, I\u2019m really weird, if you can imagine as I do the performing and I\u2019m on stage, doing this is my job. It\u2019s different to stand up in front of people like this when there\u2019s this light and speak and, you know, express yourself in this way.\n\nBut, I told myself, okay, how am I gonna be able to do this, let me just talk about my life. That\u2019s something I know, better than anyone else. And, I feel like coming from Cleveland, coming from Shaker, you know, such a diverse place, and just looking in the audience from the people I can\u2019t see, it\u2019s still \u2026 very diverse. But, I believe that my upbringing in this town, the school, district, is what made me the man I am today.\n\nAnd when I moved away when I was 20 years old, my mom was extremely sad \u2013 where\u2019s my mom at? Yeah. She was crying. Hey Mommy. My first big fan was my mom. And, it was really interesting, I remember leaving home, and she\u2019s giving me a hug at the airport, and she leans and she goes: \u201cYou can always come back around, you can go right back home, you can change your mind, everything will be fine.\u201d I\u2019m like: \u201cNo, I\u2019m going, this is happening.\u201d And you know, walk into security and then looking back and just seeing her like: \u201cOhhh...\u201d And me just being like: \u201cErrr\u2026\u201d\n\nHowever, as soon as I turned back around, I knew I was on a mission, on this very specific quest. You know? It was bigger than just wanting to be a musician, or do movies. It was about: Finally showing the world what Scott could do. I wasn\u2019t the best student, I\u2019mma be honest with you, Kendra knows this. If Kendra was in my class and she was sitting next to me I probably would have tried to cheat off her.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the point. The point is, it\u2019s like: When I think about it, you know, I wish I applied myself as much as I applied all the energy into music as I did, as in music as, you know, as in music, I wish I could have applied that same energy into my academics when I was in school. So a lot of people look at me now and they go: \u201cOh man, this must be dope to be a rapper.\u201d And it is dope, it\u2019s awesome. (?)\n\nBut, you know, I can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t wanna sometimes go back and relearn some things. I can\u2019t say I don\u2019t feel out of certain conversations that my friends have. You know, and these are things that I think about, you know, cause being at school is all about being cool and wearing the fresh \u2013 I was gonna curse but \u2013 wearing fresh clothing. And being popular. And, when you go out into the real world, you realize that that moment is just a little beep of your life. High school, you know. Now I remember Kendra (?), but everything else I don\u2019t remember. No I\u2019m just joking. But I\u2019m just saying: At that moment in life you feel like that\u2019s all that matters. High school, it\u2019s like: Oh this girl doesn\u2019t like me, this guy here and there\u2019s all this drama, this drama, and you go into the real world and you know it\u2019s about just trying to make your mark in the world. And I never got the chance to do that academically.\n\nSo I had this fire, I had this fire to pursue this musical career. I had no idea how to go about it. I was living with my uncle who was up in the age at the time. 80 years old. Older uncle. So when I moved to New York it\u2019s not he could show me around, show me all the cool spots, you know, he was just kinda like: \u201cThere\u2019s the train and you get a metro card, and you go.\u201d And I was: \u201cYeah okay, we got the Rapid, I can do this. It\u2019s all right.\u201d I was immediately wrong for that, for assuming that it was gonna be the same. It is not the same.\n\nUm, but, I embraced it. I embraced the fear, the danger. I enjoyed the fact that I was going in uncharted territory. It was like a sense of wonder for me. And, I can\u2019t say I was one of those people that was into like having thrills and, you know, getting some type of stimulation from that, but it was nothing like saying, like: \u201cY\u2019all I\u2019m gonna out and pursue something and I know I\u2019m gonna do it. And nobody\u2019s gonna tell me I can\u2019t. And everybody that doesn\u2019t believe it I\u2019mma prove it to \u2018em sooner or later. And that\u2019s just what it is.\u201d Because I won\u2019t point I didn\u2019t feel like I was smart enough to pass that test. Or I didn\u2019t feel like I was smart enough to go to this college.\n\nBut with music it was like: Nobody\u2019s gonna take that from me. You know what I\u2019m saying? Because it was things that I was dealing with as a youth at this school that I didn\u2019t talk to people about. That probably kept me from put my best foot forward with my academics. You know? And with music, it was a platform for me to express myself and also realize that I\u2019m not that crazy. That there\u2019s other kids out there that might me depressed or lonely, dealing with suicide, things like this.\n\nAnd, it was one of those things that, you know, I just feel really blessed to just have my mom who has been my supporter forever, who supplied that trip financially, first couple of months or whatever. Um, to have the support of my home town, I can come back in this room and just feel the love and energy, you guys got me really nervous, my palms are sweaty. But, um, it\u2019s really just the clock, it\u2019s like: 11 minutes, 24 seconds, 23 seconds, 22 seconds \u2026 It\u2019s like what\u2019s gonna happen when that clock\u2019s over with? It\u2019s like somebody gon\u2019 just pull me off stage? Geez.\n\nUm. But um, really, I, first thing I did when I went to New York, and most people think it was kinda like this amazing adventure \u2013 it wasn\u2019t. It was pretty much finding a job. And for the first couple years I was working everywhere. You know, whether it was like at this clothing store here, or Abercrombie & Fitch, or American Apparel, or Dean & DeLuca, I always had a job. I was a hustler. And, you know, I still apply that same work ethic with the music.\n\nYou know what I mean, like, I\u2019m almost in a way don\u2019t know how to relax because my whole life has been just a grind. You know what I mean? And, I think that, when people ask me: \u201cMan, how do you do it\u201d, you know, I\u2019m just kinda like: \u201cI don\u2019t know, like I was just \u2026 focused?\u201d You know? Because it\u2019s hard to put it into words because I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s just something I flipped, a switch I just flipped when I turned 20. Like I was always this guy.\n\nYou know, I was always outspoken and creative and artsy, I used to draw when I was a kid, it was before all the musical stuff came along. I was an artist. You know, I used to draw all my stuff, I used to draw all my tattoos and I said: \u201cOh when I get 18, I\u2019mma draw, I\u2019mma get these tatted.\u201d It was about being a cartoonist up until I was like 15. And then I just wanted to be a rapper. And then it was all uphill from that.\n\nBut, you know, \u2026 if I could really just give people one piece of advice, you know, and it just passes along, and one thing I want you to take from this, is that like, we are all the commanders of our own destiny.\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\nIt\u2019s like you see these movies where they say, like that one movie with \u2026 Lucy, where she has 100 percent of her brain power and she can do anything she wants. You know, and you realize that the average human doesn\u2019t use at \u2026 two, three percent. You know what I mean? Some weird small percentage like that.\n\nI really just told myself from jump like: \u201cHey man, I\u2019m gonna do this, and I apply the information that I needed to execute that and in places, times of my life where I didn\u2019t have the answers, I make sure to get the information or surround myself with people that had the information.\u201d You know what I mean? You can\u2019t hang out with people that ain\u2019t doing nothing. How you gon\u2019 get money, hanging around with people that ain\u2019t got no money? You know what I\u2019m saying?\n\nLike, how you gon\u2019 be inspired by people who aren\u2019t at least trying to go the same way, at least, whether it\u2019s music, or schooling, like I would be inspired by all my friends, cause, I went to college, I went to University Toledo for one year for film \u2013 it sucked, I hated it. You know, it wasn\u2019t for me. But my film class, my film classes were amazing, um, and now that I\u2019m doing acting, producing shows, writing shows, I wish I wrote that whole couple, three more years out, cause I would have information that I needed, and I wouldn\u2019t have to go through so many hoops, to be able to direct or create my own film or TV show. Um, I don\u2019t know why I said that, let me get back on track \u2026 Okay.\n\nSo, um, really, you know, people, like I say, come up to me all the time and they like: \u201cMan but you did it man, you\u2019re special, you\u2019re different\u201d \u2013 and I\u2019m not. Any different. From you, you \u2013 we\u2019re all the same. I came from this town. I went to this school. All my buddies, we all had the same opportunities, you know? It\u2019s kinda just like: Having that self-confidence. You know? And it was a lot of areas in my personality where I wasn\u2019t as confident. You know? Definitely with the chicks. Early on. I don\u2019t know if Kendra knows this.\n\nBut the music, me doing something, where I was like: \u201cWow, I made this!\u201d Like my first album, when that came out, I was like: \u201cWow! I made this, this is something that I put all my energy into, and it\u2019s out and it\u2019s released to the world on a professional level.\u201d I was so proud of myself. But: \u201cLet\u2019s do it again.\u201d I didn\u2019t have time to be like: \u201cYeah, my first album, yeah, yeah, people like it\u201d, it was like: \u201cOkay, we did good, it didn\u2019t suck, what are we gonna do again, we gotta do another one.\u201d And then I did that one: \u201cOkay, people like it, let\u2019s do a third one.\u201d You can\u2019t get caught up in just all the other things, you know, I really was like, even still to this day, I have my front, but it\u2019s focused, you know, it\u2019s never, you know, even when I do straight, I\u2019m still working. I\u2019m still writing a song, I\u2019m still doing something. I\u2019m persistent.\n\nYou know, um, and that\u2019s also another part, you know, I believe that some people get lazy. Some people might have that one painting that they started to paint and never finish it. Because they get caught up in their head and it\u2019s: \u201cOh, I can\u2019t do this, maybe I can\u2019t do this.\u201d It\u2019s like sticking to something. One goal at a time. You know, that was like, that\u2019s still big for me. I never put too much on my plate. You know, at first it was like the music, and then the acting kinda came into play, early on, and I, it was unexpected, but it was a blessing, that I was prepared for. I was like: \u201cMan. I\u2019ve been a class clown since forever, let\u2019s do this.\u201d And I used to do it for free, now I\u2019m getting paid for, this is great. Um, so, you know, I\u2019m glad you guys like my jokes, I\u2019m not even a comedian, this is just\u2026\n\nUm, so, you know, just kinda fast forward cause it\u2019s so much I\u2019m tryna squeeze into 5 minutes, 56 seconds. Um, but, you know man, there are a lot of haters, there are a lot of doubters, there are a lot of people that would telling me: \u201cMan you ain\u2019t gon\u2019 do that.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not gon\u2019 happen.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll be back.\u201d I would tell all my buddies: \u201cI\u2019m moving to New York\u201d \u2013 \u201cAll right! You\u2019ll be back!\u201d Nah. Nah. I\u2019m not coming back. And if I do come back, it\u2019s for a concert. You know? And everybody be like: \u201cAlright, whatever.\u201d\n\nAnd when I came back it was for a concert. It was for a concert, and it was the most beautiful homecoming I\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s no show more important than this show. And I\u2019m not just saying that because it was like: In Cleveland, and it\u2019s like, my home town. It was the first time I saw my peers, friends I went to school with, being proud of me. I didn\u2019t get the moment to walk across stage with everybody. I didn\u2019t get the cap and gown. You know what I mean? I didn\u2019t get the chance to see these guys because I moved to Solon, 11th grade. It\u2019s like even seeing Kendra is wild, because I haven\u2019t seen anybody in so long. Um, but, that\u2019s the beautiful moment, still to this day, I do shows and I see a class mate in the crowd and I forget my raps, I\u2019m gonna: \u201cOh \u2026 oh \u2026 happy, you got any kids, I\u2019m sorry, I gotta \u2026\u201d, you know? It\u2019s wild. You know?\n\nAnd, I didn\u2019t get that at school. I didn\u2019t play on the football team \u2013 I tried, but I was terrible. I didn\u2019t play on the basketball team \u2013 I tried, but I was terrible. I didn\u2019t wrestle. I tried \u2013 no, no. I did try. But I tried outside of the Shaker Heights High School, in another district in Cleveland Heights, where none of my peers could see me and me be embarrassed. It was kinda just like: \u201cOkay I try this in 7th grade and be terrible and then nobody in Shaker will know about it \u2013 cause it\u2019s in Cleveland Heights, they\u2019re just talking over there.\u201d\n\nBut my point is also like music was my plan G. You know, it wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t try anything else, like I tried everything else. I tried everything I thought, you know, was a traditional thing a young boy should do \u2013 sports, you know, and even going to college was me just tryna fulfill a destiny where I thought it was my own destiny, but also I wanted to make my mom happy. You know? And sometimes guys, we gotta do that. You know, there\u2019s a lot of things that we don\u2019t wanna do stuff, but it\u2019s like, man, like, your parents (?), they really have to deal with a lot of our shit. And you know it\u2019s like, and now I\u2019m at 31 and I\u2019m just like: I have to apologize to my mom, was it like seven years ago, I was like: \u201cMom, I am sorry.\u201d Like: \u201cI was a nightmare. But we got money now, so let\u2019s just go like\u2026\u201d And we\u2019re okay. We\u2019re good now.\n\nUm, and it\u2019s funny, too, cause I took my mom to get her first tattoo ever, I forced her to get a tattoo, and it\u2019s so funny, cause she \u2013 are you, are you embarrassed, I\u2019m sorry. But this is big, you know, because our relationship from the kid I was at high school, it\u2019s the best it\u2019s ever been. You know, I used to put my mom through hell. But, she was my supporter. And that\u2019s what parents are there to do. To give you the devil\u2019s advocate, even when, I\u2019m not gon\u2019 say, every time I told my mom I was moving to New York, she was like: \u201cPff. Okay. Aight.\u201d You know, but that was more so like the fear of letting your child go out into the world, more so like the people in the street that are just hating on you don\u2019t wanna see you win.\n\nParents care. Now I got a four-and-a-half-year-old, she\u2019ll be five in march. She\u2019s the apple of my eye. She\u2019s my little baby. And, she\u2019s so funny, you know, cause, I\u2019m the one who gets emotional when she has to leave, you know, and I\u2019m kinda just like, when she\u2019s leaving, I\u2019m like: \u201cYou know I\u2019mma miss you, right?\u201d And then she\u2019s like: \u201cYeah.\u201d And I\u2019m like: \u201cYou gon\u2019 miss Daddy?\u201d \u2013 \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cOh my \u2026 You know you can call me and stuff, when you miss me? And I\u2019m just sad you\u2019re leaving.\u201d She\u2019s like: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We always come back.\u201d And I was just like: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, all that, that\u2019s why I\u2019m crying, I\u2019m so emotional!\u201d But it was just like beautiful to just see, you know like, me be the parent now. You know what I\u2019m saying? And to see that confidence of my child, and the same confidence I gave my mom and you gotta just kinda take it backseat and go: \u201cOkay.\u201d Cause I literally like follow my daughter\u2019s lead. I mean, I just, whatever she is telling me to do, I just follow whatever she \u2013 well I mean, obviously not in every way. Or else like, I would be broke, but \u2026 in some ways I do what she asks me to do or what she tells me to do.\n\nBut, that\u2019s the beauty of life y\u2019all. You know what I\u2019m saying? I used to come in this room, I used to sit right in that section. Sometimes I\u2019d pay attention \u2013 sometimes I wouldn\u2019t. Most of the time I\u2019d be checking out chicks. Some chick I probably never talk to cause I never had the confidence, maybe if a \u2013 what\u2019s the day that we would send carnations, Kendra? Valentine\u2019s Day. That wasn\u2019t a joke. I was the king of like, sending, like, carnations to chicks that I never talk to. I would be asking my mom for like: \u201cMom, can you give me five bucks, you know it\u2019s (?) today, I wanna (?).\u201d And, she would just be like: \u201cOkay\u201d, you know? Not knowing that I was buying carnations for all these chicks, you know, but, thanks for supplying that, Mom.\n\nBut, with 23 seconds left. I just what y\u2019all know that life will throw you through shit ton of curve balls, it\u2019s scary, but like, if you believe man. You know? I you believe. And if you want it. And if you wanna work hard enough for it. You can be so. Cause it\u2019s no difference from me and you. I just really wanted this shit. I wanted it bad. You know? And I didn\u2019t want to be a failure. And nobody\u2019s a failure in this room. Don\u2019t ever think that. We can all win.

to\nBeing a leader in this day and age is being a threat\nNot many people stood up against the system we all call life\nBut toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice\nA voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time\nA voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest\nThis is the
