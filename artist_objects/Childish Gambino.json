whiskey\nAnd these hoes are actin' different cause I'm Rich comma Richie\nThese friends are iffy, they're alcoholic geniuses\nI think they hang around until I'm drunk and buy them Guinnesses\nI gotta drink my medicine to cover what's inside of me\nI'm still fucked up from the days nobody liked me\nI'm lying just a little when I say that I don't give a fuck\nYou know I gotta give a fuck\nYou know I gotta give a fuck\nMy face is broken out\nMy shirt is hand-me-down\nThis kid named Vincent wanna take my shirt and lay me out\nI'm trying to fit in like a fat bitch in her shoe size\nIt's funny how I'm flyer now than witches on their broom rides\nI always thought these new clothes were the potion\nCause I never felt that good in my own skin\nIt's probably cause I'm the only black kid in my school\nAnd when I meet another black kid they tell me I'm a fool\nCause I wear these tight clothes, tight jeans, tight shirt\nYeah I stay tight like these girls that make my dick hurt\nYeah, I'm self conscious\nGo ahead, laugh it up\nCause I dig deep and pull something out to back it up\nThey told my ass to blacken up\nWhat the fuck are you?\nYou don't even say shit\nQuit writing gay shit\nNow they see me, have to squint like Asians\nCause I'm too bright like an old night light\nWhen I do not talk, I am being polite\nRap all night\nAct all day\nMama so scared 'imma waste away\nI don't have time to sleep\nI don't have time to eat\nThese niggas got time to do\nEverything but be unique\nI gotta do me like I'm jerkin' to a mirror\nI am just a rapper\nCan't make it clearer\nTo every kid in a

I hear a lot of tradtional trap drums and sounds on the new album, which make sense since your from the south, but you didn\u2019t really do that on Camp.

I really hope in 10 years I can be as successful and well respected as you. I already liked your comedy and acting, but ever since I found out you rapped and I heard that E.E.

Does this translate to the relationship between mixtapes and albums in rap?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nShort films just fit normal people a little better. time is ultimate currency. we don\u2019t have a lot of time to spend. a short film, for me, leaves more to the audience, and doesn\u2019t take so much time. And if it\u2019s free, then you really have no excuse not to watch it and at least have an opinion\n@Flowmatic\n\nWhats your perspective on camp looking back at it now ?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nI love camp. it there\u2019s little things i\u2019d change, cause i know how music better, but yeah. i does what it\u2019s supposed to do\n@FlyTendencies\n\nHow do you sing so beautifully?\n\n@ChildishGambino\n\nThat\u2019s what you call it?\n@A1_Day\n\nDid My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus\u2019s sound play a role in Because The Internet?

call you with the speaker on\nHorse head in your bed, now you know who you sleeping on\nAre you seeing what I\u2019m seeing?\nThis booth is a crime scene\nChalk off the mic, the kill screen is my

CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY\n\nA white bus opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming. After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, A\nLITTLE BOY steps off. He's walking slow and somber\n\nAll the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end\n\nA chauffeur (old heavyset white guy) stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is\n\nHe holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo\n\nThe Boy's FATHER (Rick Ross) is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off\n\nThe Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FATHER: How was camp?\n\nThe Boy \"shrugs\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FATHER (CONT'D): You make any friends?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: No\n\nThe father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Frito pie\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (cutting him off): It's Frito pie\n\nSilence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window\n\nEXT. MANSION - DAY\n\nThe Chauffeur helps Father out the car. The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home. The Mansion is dope. Very Big, and not gaudy. It looks classic\n\nINT. MANSION - DAY\n\nAn infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs. You can see all of this from the foyer, which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it. The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care\n\nThe Father's phone rings:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FATHER: Hello\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0PHONE VOICE: Hello, this is the Califax collection-\n\nFather hangs up. His cell phone goes off\n\nThe Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out\n\nINT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY\n\nThe Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway. He kicks off his shoes. They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground. We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years. Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice\n\nThe Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics\n\nHe starts checking his mail. His friend \"FAM\" sent him something that says \"this is you\" with a link. The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video\n\nHe goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as \"VERY HOTTTTTTT\". The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying\n\n\"This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future! [CRYING EMOJI]\" is the top comment\n\nThe Boy stares. Then types \"fuck u niggers\" in the comments\n\nHe waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart\n\nHe refreshes the page. People immediately respond with \"Fuck U\", \"You wouldn't say that to my face faggot\", and \"LMFAO crackers b crazy\"\n\nThe Boy smiles\n...bec a use the in t e  rnet15 YEARS LATER\n\n*******[PLAY SONG \"CRAWL\" AT THIS POINT]*******\n\nINT. THE BOY'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING\n\nThe room is an elegant mess. There's shit everywhere, but everything has its place. Classic furniture; someone with old money would invest in, is used for the bed, desk, desk chair. You can see from where most of the trash accumulates that the occupant spends most of his time on the computer\n\nThere is a pile of stacked and flattened gummy bear wrappers by the desk. There's a picture of The Boy and his father on the boy's desk, along with a flash drive that has \"hackz\" written on it. A small vaporizer charges and glows green on the edge. There's a half ounce of weed in a plastic bag to the left of the laptop on the desk\n\nThere's a black and white Bill Withers poster, a Gorillaz \"Demon Days\" poster, and a \"Black Dynamite\" poster. All framed. Stacks of records are placed on a shelf lining the wall. There are some old 70's soul records by a record player on the shelf.

Bunnies jump on the lawn in the background\nThe boy sits under a sun umbrella, opens the pop tart and starts to eat it. He looks off with his face flat.

Politicians, athletes, entertainers, etc. His favorite was simply re-tweeting something someone says. When it was dumb enough to just re-tweet, that was his favorite. He'd gotten a lot of followers that way. Written an article once for a blog. Got more followers.

The groom looks like a caricature of a good ol' fashion white dude\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0STEVE: Good for him\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SWANK: Nah. He don't get any interracial points.

Like that?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SWANK: Man, I used to get so pissed when girls would watch Boy Meets World and be like \"Ryder Strong's so dope for having a black girlfriend\". Man, fuck that nigga\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0AJ: Come on, man. My dad's white and his parents didn't like my mom.

The Boy walks into the banquet\n\nINT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT\n\nThe lights are low. Most of the people have gotten up to pee or something. The Boy just stares at the couple. Then he decides to start recording. A man comes up to him\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE:Who are you here with?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (not looking up from his phone): The groom.

That's what I said thirty years ago\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I don't believe in marriage. (then) Maybe that's not true.

But how many women you know are interested in your concept?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: More than you'd think. I find if you have a job and are actually interested in raising a child, women, who are a little older, tend to be responsive. I just don't think they like being labeled that. (then) Do you get tired of it?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Of marriage?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Of marriage. Of her.

I\nDon't regret it\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Well I don't have to man-up. I did what I'm supposed to do. I found the things I'm good at. I didn't get anyone pregnant on the way there. And I've had mature relationships that prepared me for what marriage is\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Mature relationships?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Yeah.

I post those responses and/or convos on my blog. And I charge gossip blogs and advertisers to advertise on my site and sometimes me and my friend put out novelty books of fucked up things we find online while digging up dirt on said celebrities and/ or politicians and sell it to niche book stores or larger stores that fit our aesthetic\n\nThe man just stares, not understanding\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (CONT'D): How old are you?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Fifty-three\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: I'm like Bill O'Reilly\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Oh\n\nThe older man leaves.

You gotta deal!\n\nEveryone laughs\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MAN IN SUIT (CONT'D): But honestly, may you two spend the rest of your lives healthy and happy\n\n\"Awwww\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MAN IN SUIT (CONT'D): And now, the traditional \"march to forever\" to bless the bride and groom with happiness for all their days to come\n\nEveryone claps\n\n*******[PLAY SONG \"3005\" AT THIS POINT]*******\n\n[VISUAL]\n\nLittle creatures slowly start to march out from the kitchen. Some have banners that say \"HAPPY MARRIAGE!\". Some have sparklers. They all bounce on beat. It's cute for a very short moment. Then it feels wrong\n\nAll the creatures have two legs, two arms, like humans.  But they are definitely not humans. One of the giveaways being that they are naked, but don't seem to have genitals\n\nAll the creatures are breathing heavy out their mouths (their noses being two tiny slits probably don't allow for heavy air traffic)\n\nThey're about three feet high. Their eyes are larger than they should be and are spread farther on their faces. They don't have hair anywhere on their bodies. They all have forced smiles on their faces. You can see their teeth are just a little too sharp when they smile. Insinuating carnivorous behavior. If they wanted to, at any point they could jump on you and rip out your throat in .8 seconds. But they're not right now. They're marching\nOne of the creatures has tears in its eyes. Still smiling tho. Pushing the smile\n\nEveryone is smiling as they march past, but they're all very cautious. Clearly worried that one may attack. The Boy watches as the creatures reach the front of the party and form a circle. They do this weird clapping, almost step team routine, then stop. The music stops\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CREATURE 1: We did it!\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CREATURE 2: Yay!\n\nEveryone claps. The bride and groom force a smile. The creatures slowly make their way back to the kitchen. All that's heard is their struggled breathing and clammy skin hitting the wooden dance floor.

They're arguing about driving, or cooking with coconut oil instead of olive oil, or something else they themselves will not care about or remember in a month, year, ten years, 100 years, the age of the universe\n\nThe house is starting to look pretty bad. The cleaners that used to come stopped receiving their payment and stopped coming. Plastic cups are starting to spread like a blue rash across the living room and coffee tables. Every surface has a sticky spot. You used to be able to slide into the kitchen from the living room with a two second run and quick stop. Now, dried alcohol stops you before you even get to the kitchen door. The Boy really loved sliding into the kitchen when he was a kid. It was the closest you could get to having powers\n\n*******[PLAY SONG \"THE PARTY\" AT THIS POINT]*******\n\n[VISUAL]\n\nMinutes go by. People start to crowd around The Boy as he continues on piano. So many people he can't think\n\nFam daps up a kid as he walks in. They then walk over to a closet where Fam opens up a pantry of weed. It's not nostalgic rap video stocked with weed, but there's a lot of weed in there. Fam tosses an ounce of weed at the kid. The kid and his friend smell it and nod. They look to Fam to share a smile of like \"good shit, right?\", but Fam isn't there for em. Fam gives em the \"where's my money you privileged ass-hole\" look. They pull out some hundreds\n\nMisla is sitting knees to chest with a french dude in the center of the pool table. They're eating s'mores\n\nEmily and Steve are jumping over the fire pit like idiots\n\nThere are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose tonight. It's a great time\n\nBut then:\n\n...this is a waste\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Get\n\n...of time\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (CONT'D): Out. Everyone\n\nNo one can hear him.

Glass sprays everywhere, alcohol splashes, people start running out\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SOME DUDE 2: Worldstar!\n\nThe Boy continues hitting things. He's about to come down on somoeone's phone that's lying on the coffee table. He holds the pool cue above his head and lets it down fast\n\nBut right before, someone grabs the cell phone, laying their hand on top of it, daring The Boy to hit the hand. The Boy barely stops in time\nThe hand has a cast on it. The Boy looks up to see a girl (NAOMI) staring at him. She looks mad. The Boy is mad. But not at her. He's trying to look mad at her, but he really looks like \"sorry\"\nEyes locked\nShe slowly takes her phone, making complete eye contact the entire time, then walks out. Everyone stares at this strange interaction\nAs soon as she leaves, The Boy goes back to smashing things\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Get out! Get away!\n\nSome people start running out trying not to get hit. Other people just laugh cause they're high or because they think it's pathetic. They all leave eventually\nThe Boy stands there for a moment. He turns to the bar next to the pool table. There's half a blunt and a bottle of Sriracha sitting there. The Boy takes the bottle and starts squirting it on the pool table\nWhen he's done, he's written: \"ROSCOE'S WETSUIT\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAM: Nice\n\nThe Boy turns.

THE BOY'S ROOM - LATER NIGHT\nThe Boy lays in his bed. Blue and black stripes from the shades fold over his face. He can hear raccoons scurrying outside\nHe sees a spider in the corner of the room. Just sitting in its web\n94\nThe Boy doesn't particularly like or dislike spiders. They're everywhere in the house. It's a big house and it's right next to a reserve. But something about this spider sitting there...it really bothers him. It makes him mad. He can hear the spider. Just sitting there. Getting louder\nI'm going to describe it as emotional tinnitus: when everything is silent and quiet, you can see the empty web you're in. It is annoying. Which is the slowest form of torture\n...The Boy gets up\n\nCUT TO:INT. CAR - NIGHT\nThe Boy drives. I'm not sure where he's driving. He's not sure where he's driving\nHe drives about an hour out into some industrial wasteland-looking nook of Los Angeles\nHe parks his car\n\n[VISUAL]\nThen, barefoot, he sits on the roof of his car and watches the cars pass. Bright lights grow to an explosion then fade out as they pass. He goes into his pocket and holds the \"hackz\" flash drive that we saw on his desk at the beginning\nSomeone spray painted \"ROSCOE'S WETSUIT\" on the side of the bridge. The Boy is not surprised. It's not making more sense, but it's becoming more dependable, which is always nice\nThe Boy realizes he hasn't eaten all day. Maybe that's what's wrong\n\nCUT TO:\nEXT. FATBURGER - NIGHT\nThe Boy orders a burger in the drive thru\nA skinny Latino kid with a Bluetooth hands him the bag. The Boy pulls over to the side and opens the bag. He looks at the burger for a moment\nThe Boy throws the burger out\n\nCUT TO:\nINT. MANSION - NIGHT\nThe Boy walks through the house; locking all the doors and turning off all the lights. It's always a weird feeling to walk around the house at night because most of the walls are glass, so people can see right inside, especially when it's dark. It's pretty hard to even get to the house, it's the highest home on the hill and there's a long winding road before . But at the same time, if someone got up there, it'd be easy to figure out how to get in\nAll the lights are off now\nThe Boy walks over to The Buddha in the middle of the foyer. He sits on the floor next to him with his knees to his chest. Looking out the front door into half the darkness and half his reflection. He used to be terrified of this Buddha. When he was little, he'd run behind the statue like it would jump on him as soon as he past. But He slowly became something like a best friend. Something like that\n\nINT. THE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT\nThe Boy pours Pelligrino into a wine glass. Then he continues to twist his metal weed grinder in his hand. He takes the top off the grinder and pours the white powder inside the glass. He drinks it, then sits on the foot of the bed and takes off his white T-shirt\nPulling the covers over his body, he looks at the spider in the corner...only it was gone. Where'd it go?

One of the ladies just said something funny cause there's a lot of laughter\n\nSitcom laughs always freaked him out. Because most of those people are dead. Those are ghost laughs. Laughs that are supposed to be gone forever linger on earth after every mid 90s joke about teenage sex or someone saying \"don't go there\". Looking for their mouths, never finding them because they're gone. The laughs don't feel good because they're dead laughs. Those laughs aren't what they stood for anymore. They've been reappropriated.

JET PLANE - EVENING\nThe Boy lays his head against the plane window, the oil from his hair leaving grease smudges all over the window\nHis father died in Stockholm. A family member was needed. Didn't realize that they were each other's only family til this very moment. When you lose that, you basically lose most of your memories, at least the accuracy of your own memories\nHe wanted to be cremated\nThe Boy didn't really know anyone in Stockholm, but he also didn't want to be in his hotel room with his father for a day. Even if he was just ashes. So he decided to search through his followers for someone from Sweden\n\nSome girl named \"Hello_Pity_\" Dm'd him back and they were supposed to meet up after all the whatever he had to do. Her profile bio said she was half french. She looked pretty in her avi: an inverted Hello Kitty. But that really doesn't mean anything at all, especially since her instagram was blocked, which is something he's learned not to trust at all\nSo he looked through her tweets, figured out a night she went to a club, used one of his dummy profiles and pretended that they'd met at the club that night. She had trouble remembering because, according to her feed, she was \"fuckin turnt, [CRAZY TONGUE OUT EMOJI] lol\". She added this made up dude as a friend on Facebook. Now The Boy could see her pictures\nThe rest of her pictures confirmed she was indeed pretty\nThis girl loves Justin Bieber though. New Justin Bieber. The \"fuck you\" Bieber. She loves Justin Bieber in the way you love that girl on Maury who's like \"my favorite flavor popsicle is DICK!\", which is close to sincere love, but nowhere near it at the same time\n\nINT.

It's a big inside joke that you can't mess up and only one other person in the world gets\n\nIt's not a very pretty or perfect love, or even necessarily a romantic love. It doesn't look cool.  It's more like two helpless things in the wild, and one says \"I'll protect you\", and both parties know it's a lie because there's no way either of them can protect the other from anything. That lie is the best way to describe this love. That feeling of not having to say \"I'm scared\", because you share the exact feelings without having words over or under complicate it, that's worth more than protection. It's a connection. The less alone. This is all we look for on earth\n\nThe Boy and Naomi hang a lot. They spend the night and make breakfast sometimes. He buys stuff for her. She makes him stuff. They watch cartoons together. They're always saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. They both have a purpose. It's a great time.

The electricity bill would be high, but he stopped living in the mansion. He started renting another place to stay and keep the business separate\n\nTo be honest it was getting a little out of hand, as Naomi predicted. The Boy is not a good dealer.

I-10 - DAY\n\nThe Boy is driving down the highway listening to \"Danny Glover\" by Young Thug\n\nEXT. MANSION - DAY\n\nThe car parks in the driveway. There are three cars already there. When he pulls up, he's playing \"Made in America\" by JAY Z and Kanye. When it goes off, he continues singing his version while walking up\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Sweet Cream Havarti/ Sweet Mozzarella/ Sweet Cheez-its. They're made in America/ Sweet Bowl of Cheez-its/ Ohhhhh-oohhhhh-\n\nFour dudes are standing waiting at the front door\n\nSomething is wrong\n\nThe Boy stops singing and stands there in front of the dudes. They look at him\nAlone\n\nThey all pull out 45s\n\n****[PLAY SONG \"EARTH: THE OLDEST COMPUTER\" AT THIS POINT]****\n\nINT. MANSION - DAY\n\nThey all walk in\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0DUDE 1: Where the packs?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: In that closet\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0DUDE 1: Sit over there\n\n[VISUAL]\nThe Boy sits in the living room. Maybe he could run out the back? Where though?\n\nThey're at the top of a mountain. If someone heard a shot in this neighborhood, they'd call the police immediately. Unfortunately, there isn't a police department in the Palisades. He'd be waiting for the Santa Monica department, which would take a minute\n\nThe feeling The Boy had now was shockingly similar to the feeling he got at his own parties. People he didn't know or like casually walking through his home and him having to pretend everything is \"fine\", or that they don't have all the power\n\nMaybe he could text Fam\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0DUDE 1 (CONT'D): Give me your phone\n\nThe Boy hands him his phone. Fuck\n\nTwo dudes stand guard at the front and back exits. One dude packs the bricks from\nThe closet in a trash bag. Dude 1 (seems to be the leader) is looking through The Boy's phone\n\nIt didn't feel like the day The Boy was going to die. Not to say The Boy didn't feel like he was going to die, he was certain he was going to die today. But he didn't feel like today felt like a/the last day/night. Like a Wednesday that keeps feeling like a Friday. But the more he thought about it, if the last day felt like the last day, the world would be a different place. The order we have everyday would vanish if you were guaranteed a warning. People wouldn't live like they do\n\nThey wouldn't care what you thought. It'd be anarchy. Or a utopia. Depending on who you ask\n\nDude 1 puts The Boy's phone in his pocket. The Boy doesn't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Dude 1 and Dude 2 start talking. It's obvious they're discussing The Boy's fate\n\nIf I was the director, the one who made this moment, the one who saw this moment millennia before, the one who coded this world and allowed this to happen, I'd have Thundercat's \"We'll Die\" playing as The Boy looks around at his once castle\n\n...try to do your best\n\nOh! It's like Tony Montana. But resigned and, frankly, more realistic, cause it's boring. Everybody dies. Most of them are boring\n\nAll the dudes walk out except Dude 2. He stays. Dude 1 still has his phone as he walks out. The Boy realizes this action is bad\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0DUDE 2: Toss me your wallet\n\nThis is bad. The Boy tosses the wallet. Dude 2 looks through it\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Can I drown?\n\nDude 2 looks up\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (CONT'D): I just want to die how I want\n\nThere's a pool out there. You're supposed to get this wave of euphoria when you drown. Supposed to be good\n\nDude 2 stares\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (CONT'D): I could just float there. They'd find me\n\nDude 2 starts to walks over...\n\n(Does it change anything when you're aware of your last thoughts?)\n\nDude 2 sits next to him\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0DUDE 2: We've been watching you for a while. You're very sloppy\n\nHe's a cop. This nigga's a cop\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0DUDE 2 (CONT'D): I'm just gonna stay here with you for a minute. My guys are picking up those guys up the street\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY: Oh\n\nSilence\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THE BOY (CONT'D): I'm going to jail?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0DUDE 2: Yep\n\nThe Boy looks to the pool in the backyard and sees his own body floating lifeless\n\n[VISUAL]\n\nEyes wide, bubbles clinging to his face. Orange, yellow, and brown leaves float above him. His left shoe floating far ahead, probably from struggling at some point. Next to the pool, Naomi and Steve stand over him. Neither is crying or really seem too upset.  They just look on as if the movie they were watching took an abrupt turn and they're mildly interested rather than satisfied\nIt looks peaceful. Fitting. He'd like to go out like that\n\n\n...what's that sound?\n\n\nTires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up. There's a small crash outside. Yelling\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0VOICE: FREEZE!\n\nGUNSHOTS\n\nThe Boy and Dude 2 look at each other\n\nDude 1 kicks open the door. He starts firing. Dude 2 falls. A mist of red puff spurts from his chest. He's screaming\n\nDude 1 turns to The Boy and sho\n\n\n\n\n...(breath).....(breath).............(breath)..\nSilence\n*****[PLAY SONG \"LIFE: THE BIGGEST TROLL\" AT THIS POINT]*****\n\n[VISUAL]\n\nTHE

That\u2019s you\nAnd we\u2019re still at camp as long as we\u2019re on the bus\nAnd not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us\nWe\u2019re still wearing our orange camp t-shirts.

Unless I say something\nAnd it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something\nThe sun\u2019s gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep\nWe\u2019re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop\nThat looks like a kid we know\nAnd then I\u2019m like, \u201cCan I tell you something?\u201d\nAnd all of a sudden I\u2019m telling you\nAnd I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming\nAnd your face is there and gone and there and gone\nAs we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway\nAnd there\u2019s no expression on it\nAnd I think just after a point I\u2019m just talking to lengthen the time\nWhere we live in a world where you haven\u2019t said \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d yet\nAnd regrettably I end up using the word \u201cdestiny\u201d\nI don\u2019t remember in what context. Doesn\u2019t really matter\nBefore long I\u2019m out of stuff to say and you smile and say, \u201cokay\u201d\nI don\u2019t know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive\nAnd I would leave in order not to spoil the moment\nBut there\u2019s nowhere to go because we\u2019re on a bus\nSo I pretend like I\u2019m asleep and before long, I really am\n\nI wake up, the bus isn\u2019t moving anymore\nThe domed lights that line the center aisle are all on\nI turn and you\u2019re not there\nThen again a lot of kids aren\u2019t in their seats anymore\nWe\u2019re parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church\nThe bus is half empty. You might be in your dad\u2019s car by now\nYour bags and things piled high in the trunk\nThe girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time\nDisembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus\nJust as one of them reaches my row\nIt used to be our row, on our way off\nIt\u2019s Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week\nAfter throwing rocks at my head\nAdolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise\nShe stops and looks down at me\nAnd her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can\u2019t really see her face\nBut I can see her smile. And she says one word: \u201cdestiny\u201d\nThen her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh\nAnd then she turns and leads them off the bus\nI didn\u2019t know you were friends with them\n\nI find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over\nSo is summer, even though there\u2019s two weeks until school starts\nThis isn\u2019t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad\nThis is a story about how I learned something and I\u2019m not saying this thing is true or not\nI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s what I learned\nI told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody\nSo I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always\nEverybody can\u2019t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them\nBut this means there isn\u2019t a place in my life for you or someone like you\nIs it sad? Sure. But it\u2019s a sadness I chose\nI wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy\nAnd got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit\nBut that\u2019s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy.

These phone calls go way back to the time of \u201cCamp\u201d, when FATHER would immediately hang up on the company when they would call\n\nAfter THE BOY wakes up in the hospital (more on that later), SWANK tells THE BOY that his father has died. Guess where?\n\nHis father died in Stockholm. A family member was needed. Didn\u2019t realize that they were each other\u2019s only family til this very moment. When you lose that, you basically lose most of your memories, at least the accuracy of your own memories\n\nSweden. In the Northern Hemisphere. It appears FATHER was in Sweden for a while, or at least he was travelling when he died. THE BOY is called to travel there in order to collect his ashes (he wanted to be cremated). Where does ashes go? In an urn\n\nDonald has said that \u201cI. Flight of the Navigator\u201d was influenced by death. \u201cII. Zealots of Stockholm\u201d is a clear relation to Sweden (Stockholm is the capital city, duh!), and \u201cIII. Urn\u201d is both a track about death but more specifically his FATHER\n\nBecause THE BOY didn\u2019t know anyone is Sweden, he met up with a girl whom he had been tweeting to (more on that later). When THE BOY went to get a drink, the girl takes the urn with his father\u2019s ashes inside and takes them outside. THE BOY chases and catches her, wondering what the hell she is doing taking the urn\n\n[Quote: \"Because The Internet\" screenplay]\nTHE BOY: What\u2019s going on\nALYSSA: Let\u2019s get rid of it. It\u2019s just bad for you\nTHE BOY: You have a TON of nerve judging me and my father\u2019s relationship, so much so, you just walk out with his ashes? I feel like what you\u2019re doing is against the law, but much like the fact he was cremated before I arrived, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s illegal. I\u2019m still pissed though\nALYSSA: We\u2019re gonna do this together\n[End quote]\n\nHe pours the ashes out.

Even in the short film \u201cClapping For The Wrong Reasons\u201d, Chance mentions Donald by name. If \u201cClapping For The Wrong Reasons\u201d is a 100% canon, then all the secrecy of THE BOY\u2019s name is gone, so maybe it isn\u2019t completely canon\n\nIn the short film, at one point, someone enters the house and kicks their shoes off into a pile of other shoes. This is what THE BOY does in the script when he returns home from camp.", "year": "2013-12-10"}, {"artist": "Childish Gambino", "album": "\"Because The Internet\": Analysis (BecauseThe.com)", "title": "X. Roscoe\u2019s motherfucking wetsuit!", "lyrics": "Prior to the announcement of the album, Donald tweeted and retweeted the term \u201cRoscoe\u2019s Wetsuit\u201d a lot. At first, the term seemed kind of random and irrelevant, but looking at in the context of \u201cBecause The Internet\u201d, a couple of ideas make sense. Early on in the script, there is a conversation between SASHA, a girl the boys meet at the beach, and THE BOY, that gives us a good idea of what it could mean\n\nSASHA: You goin in?\nTHE BOY: Don\u2019t know yet\nSASHA: Then why\u2019d you put on your wetsuit?\n(\u201c\u2026roscoe\u2019s wetsuit\u201d)\nTHE BOY: Everyone else was\n\nNotice how the script mentions \u201cRoscoe\u2019s Wetsuit\u201d after SASHA asks THE BOY the question? Could it be a symbol of how THE BOY is unsure of his place (\u201cunsure if he wants to go in the water, but in a wetsuit because everyone else is\u201d) in life, just as he is unsure of the term which continues to be mentioned throughout the script. When THE BOY wakes up in the hospital, this is the conversation he has with the nurse\n\nWHITE GUY NURSE: You\u2019re friends brought you in-\nTHE BOY: They\u2019re not my friends\nWHITE GUY NURSE: I don\u2019t think they\u2019d like you saying that\nTHE BOY: Doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the truth. But also, they know. We\u2019re not friends. There\u2019s a mutual benefit to our relationship, but I can\u2019t trust them for shit\n\nThis kind of emphasises the point about THE BOY not really knowing his place in life\n\nThe alternative is that it\u2019s a symbol of how things on the internet affect people and cause people to \u201ctweet\u201d and \u201cretweet\u201d something they don\u2019t truly understand. When the term was being thrown around on Twitter, no one knew what it meant, but people still tweeted and retweeted it nonetheless. [Props to severlyoverdressed] A few lines in the closing track \u201cII. Life: The Biggest Troll [Andrew Auernheimer]\u201d seem to support this\n\nNever forget this feeling, never gonna reach a million\nEventually all my followers realize they don\u2019t need a leader\nStay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think\nJust remember that you the shit, but act like it don\u2019t stink\n\nThe line seems to imply that we don\u2019t need to be tweeting and retweeting what others are saying. Donald (\u201cthe leader\u201d) wants his followers to realise they don\u2019t need him, and should \u201cstay on their own shit\u201d and ignore what the \u201cclones\u201d think/say/do\n\nI just get the information retweeted or say it sucks\n\nFor this line, Rap Genius sums it up perfectly: \u201cHe\u2019s just passing on what others are saying. He\u2019s just a vessel for culture. Instead of creating culture the internet just enables people to respond and pass on culture, rather than create it themselves.\u201d\n\nI think this is the best theory for what Roscoe\u2019s Wetsuit is. That or THE BOY is actually called Roscoe and his wetsuit is fucking dope\n\nLast thing on the wetsuit: on Tumblr\u2019s IRL Childish Gambino feature, which features a real-life recreation of his characters bedroom, there is a wetsuit beside the bed.
