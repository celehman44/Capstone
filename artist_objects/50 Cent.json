Capitol is one of the many labels that are part of Universal Music Group.\n\n50 Cent launched an ultra-successful, six-times platinum debut with \"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\" in 2003, when he burst on the music scene with Eminem as his mentor. His sophomore album, 2005's \"The Massacre\" was almost as successful, but other albums didn't match his previous efforts and he expressed his unhappiness with his label. 50 Cent had been planning to release a fifth album on the label, but it was set with multiple release dates and singles, and eventfully didn't see a release.\n\nHis last album was 2009's \"Before I Self Destruct,\" which also had several release dates.\n\n\"I have had great success to date with Shady/Aftermath/Interscope and I'd like to thank Eminem and Dr. Dre for giving me an incredible opportunity,\" 50 Cent said in a statement. \"I've learned so much from them through the years. I am excited to enter this new era where I can carry out my creative vision.\"\n\n50 Cent had a plethora of hits early in his career that dominated the pop, rap and R&B charts, from \"P.I.M.P.\" to \"Candy Shop\" to the anthemic \"In da Club,\" which introduced the young rapper aside Dr. Dre and Eminem.\n\n\"Both myself and Shady Records are grateful to have had the chance to play a part in 50's career,\" Eminem said in a statement. \"Shady simply would not be what it is without 50 Cent. I've developed a great friendship with 50 over the years, and that's not going to change. We know 50 will have success in his new situation, and we remain supporters of both him and G-Unit.\"\n\nThe rapper, born Curtis Jackson, has also been a success outside of music, from film roles to fashion to books.\n\n50 Cent's new album, \"Animal Ambition,\" will be released June 3.

People either try to emulate him in some way, or they go in a different direction because they didn't like what he did. But whatever you think of him, he definitely developed his own style: He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.\n\nMy favorite 2Pac album is The Don Killuminati. It was recorded after he was shot and spent time in prison. It was like a doctor told him he was going to die, and he was trying to get it all down on paper. That's something the average rapper just could not do: build an entire album around that concept, and stay in that negative space. Everybody knows that they're going to die. But after you're in a life-threatening situation, you think about it a little more.\n\n2Pac's aggressive records are my favorite. \"Hail Mary\" is just perfect: \"Picture paragraphs unloaded/Wise words being quoted.\" Most artists now just aren't smart enough to write that, or honest enough to write a line like, \"I ain't a killer but don't push me.\" These days rappers will just tell you, \"I'll kill you.\"\n\n2Pac was like a camera. It's incredible how much he wrote \u2014 how much he documented. To me, 'Pac was more of a poet than a rapper. You can always tell when you're hearing 2Pac verse. He wrote those lyrics without any music. Notorious B.I.G. was more melody-driven \u2014 I'm sure he wrote his shit without a pen, and over the music \u2014 but 'Pac was just hashing out his life. The thing was, he was doing that when the public eye was on him, and everything he was hashing out just expanded, and that's when things got out of control.\n\nAll of us on the East Coast loved 2Pac. The music was all that mattered. That East Coast/West Coast feud was just personal beef. Now that he's not here, he's bigger than ever. I can still listen to two or three 2Pac CDs straight. Sometimes I put on 2Pac's best songs, followed by Biggie's best songs. Then I get ready to go into my next project.\n\nLaurence Fishburne told me once that he didn't like 2Pac. He told me it was because 2Pac was so much smarter than everyone around him. He said he didn't like the way 2Pac behaved because he knew that 2Pac knew better. I understood what he meant.
