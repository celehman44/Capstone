weathered it and poked its eye out\nWith the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses\nStopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is\nStuffed, so focused on the bright side\nThen you floor the gas pedal\nAnd hit the corner fast, the more asserted\nNever looking back, may hit the curb\nBut every day is a new learning curve\nAs you steer through life\nSometimes you might not wanna swerve, but you have to\nTo avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage\n\u2018Cause they hurt you so bad\nIt's like they murdered your ass\nAnd threw dirt on your casket\nBut you've returned from the ashes\nAnd

through this feeling\nAnd with a little time that should do the healing\nAnd by tomorrow you may even feel so good\nThat you're willing to forgive 'em\nEven after all the shit you been put through, this feeling\nOf resilience is building, and the flames are burning\nQuick as fire would through this building\nYou're sealed in, but you're fireproof\nFlame retardant, you withstood it\nAnd as you

your feet\nAs you barely even perspire from the heat\nExhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief\nAnd as you say goodbye to the grief\nIt's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell\nBut you've

We just worked out it was meant to be at this time. I think it's unlike any current hip hop songs. If you listen to what's going on in hip hop, this is not what this is. Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days. And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop.\n\nWe were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up. It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record. The song sort of evolves. It started one way, it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song.\n\nAnd I felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally. And then when I heard the vocals, that was pretty, exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting. And just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it. It's so well done and so smart and so funny. It's just great. In this song, we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed.\n\nIt reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think it's really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done.

for\nJust isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment\nI just thought the shit'd be different\nBut somethin' changed the minute that I got a whiff of it\nI started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin' it\nAnd it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit\nI just wanted a little bit, then it turned me to a monster\nI became a hypocrite, concert after concert\nI was rakin' in the dough, rollin' in green\nHad the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine\nBut I was losing my freedom, there was nowhere for me\nTo not go and be seen, and just go and be me\nAnd there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it\nEvery CD critics gave it a 3, then three\nYears later they go back and re-rate it\nThen called The Slim Shady LP the greatest\nThe Marshall Mathers was a classic\nThe Eminem Show was fantastic\nBut Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it\nI guess enough time just ain't passed yet\nA couple more years, that shit'll be Illmatic\nAnd eight years later, I'm still at it\nDivorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict\nAnd this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk\nMy back has been broke and I can still walk\n\n[Chorus]\nSo be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it\nAnd if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it\n'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold\nI said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it\nAnd if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it\n'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got a letter from a fan that said he's been praying for me\nEvery day and for some reason\nIt's been weighing on my mind heavy\n'Cause I don't read every letter I get\nBut something told me to go ahead and open it\nBut, why would someone pray for you\nWhen they don't know you?\nYou didn't pray for me when I was local\nAnd as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through\nJust to get to where I'm at, I've already told you\nAt least a thousand times in these rhymes\nI appreciate the prayer but I've already got God on my side\nAnd it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?\nJust watching it from a opposite standpoint\nMan, boy's got to look\nNuts, and that's the only word I can think of\nRight now, on how to describe the shit\nThis is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it\nJust watch what you wish for 'cause I got the shit\n\n[Chorus]\nSo be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it\nAnd if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it\n'Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold\nI said be careful what you wish for, 'cause you just might get it\nAnd if you get it, then you just might not know what to do with it\n'Cause it

rocking linens\nI guess that era's over man, hold on\nI'm splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at em'\nI give em' different patterns, they didn't fathom, they stealing my

Nah, courageous balls\nHad to change my style, they said I'm way too soft\nAnd I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws\nAnd the fangs been out since then\nBut up until the instant that I went against it\nIt was ingrained in me\nThat I wouldn't amount to a shitstain, I thought\nNo wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught\n\"Do I really belong in this game?\", I pondered\nI

spawns all the anger on\nBut it wasn't 'til I put the pain in song\nLearned who to aim it on that I made a spark\nStarted to spit harder shit\nLearned how to harness it while the reins were off\nAnd

make another motherfucking \u201cWe Made You,\u201d ah\nNow, I don't wanna seem indulgent\nWhen I discuss my lows and my highs\nMy demise and my uprise, pray to God\nI just open enough eyes later on\nAnd gave you the supplies and the tools\nTo hopefully use that'll make you strong\nEnough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt\n\u2018Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt\nJust having to balance my dang self\nWhen on eggshells, I was made to walk\nBut thank you, Ma, \u2018cause that gave me the\nStrength to cause Shady-mania, so when they empty that

Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon't mistake him for (Satan); it's a fatal mistake\nIf you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard!

For the most part, yeah. But I don't know if I ever feel totally great about a record when I put it out. With every record that I put out, someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when I listen to my own music, I just hear flaws in it. Like I hear 'Oh fuck! I could have done this better or that better!' And I'll work it to death. Obviously if I wasn't comfortable with it, I wouldn't put it out. But from the beginning, ever since my career started, I don't know if I've ever been totally like, this is completely it.\n\nIn this last crunch, what have you been working on?\nI guess you would say last minute jitters of \"Fuck! Are the vocals loud enough? Can you hear what I'm saying on this part? Is the beat right? Are the vocals too loud?'\" If I could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that I rapped over and put them out, I would do that. 'Cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it.\n\nBut you're not changing lyrics or anything like that? It's just all mix and sound stuff? It's just sonic shit that needs to be worked out for the most part, because when I decide to keep a song, that's pretty much it. Like, if it doesn't work, I pretty much know right away, right when I get it in the car and take it home.\n\nRolling Stone's Review of Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP 2\n\nSo why did you dye your hair blonde again?\nUm, I'll say that one was [manager Paul Rosenberg's] idea. In the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit I had thought about it. And once the songs started to come together and the picture got a little more clear of what it was gonna be, he hit me with the idea and I was like \"Yo, you know I thought about that, right?\" And he was like, \"Well you know, why not?\" And I was like \"I don't know how it's gonna look. I haven't had it in how many fucking years? Five, six years.\" I was like, \"I'm so used to it being dark,\" you know. So I just tried it. And I was like \"Fuck it.\"\n\nDid physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording?\nNot really, honestly. Because I already had most of the songs. And I don't know if I'm gonna keep it like this or how long I'm gonna keep it. But for right now it is what it is. And I feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record.\n\nFor Recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff. You recorded 100 songs or something, or at least you had 100 beats. So was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around?\nI feel like right now I'm probably working harder than I've ever worked in my life. And I've probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe the time period during The Eminem Show, which is a little hazy 'cause just so much shit was going on at that time. Just being so busy with The Eminem Show and doing the 8 Mile movie, and the soundtrack and the score to the movie. This is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly.\n\nThat's crazy.\nOnce I had the direction that I wanted to go, and you know calling it The Marshall Mathers LP 2, obviously I knew that there might be certain expectations. Like, I wouldn't want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that. So I wanted to make sure that I had the right songs to be able to call it that. So, a lot of recording. A lot of songs that people probably will never hear. We hit a couple of road blocks. There were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever. And just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and you're like, \"Fuck man! I feel like it needs this or this\" to paint the whole picture.\n\nA lot of people, maybe even you, think the original is your best album.\nIt's probably my favorite. I think some of them are my favorites for different reasons. Hate to even say that about my own record, but I mean the first three records, I think they may have captured a time period. And then I think I pretty much probably have publicly said, you know, Encore and Relapse wasn't \u2013 it was just a different time.\n\nYou've been hard on Relapse, but Tyler, the Creator says that it's his favorite hip-hop record in years. He loves that record.\nYeah, he tells me that every time I see him. I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like \"Ha ha this is funny!\" You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like \u2013 I've said this before \u2013 but it just was like \"Oh shit! I can think straight again!\" So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the ground. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.\n\nOn Recovery, obviously the world came to you on that one. How do you feel now about that record?\nI feel like that record I finally got back to where I was at maybe during The Eminem Show. Like, creatively and songwriting, I guess. I mean obviously Recovery was the first time I had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp. Aside from working with Dre, it was like I always wanted to produce my own records, because producing is fun to me too. One of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had choruses on them. It's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words. Because my own hooks, I already know what I mean when I write them. The way that I do music is, like, regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have, I always want to try to go as hard lyrically as I can. So regardless if the beat feels like \"Wow maybe this could be played on the radio,\" I'm not like, \"Maybe radio would play this so I'll just wing it.\" Like, I always have looked at it like I want to approach every record from an MCs' aspect.\n\nSo how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP? How did you decide to make your life miserable like that?\nWell here's what it is: It's not necessarily a sequel.\n\nOkay.\nAs much as it is a revisitation \u2013 like this is a different time period in my life. So there's not gonna be like, continuations of every song or anything like that. To me, it's more about the vibe and the nostalgia. One of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new, older breakbeats and sounds and shit like that. You know, retro shit, and try to make it current, like bring it up to date.\n\nSo did seeking out Rick Rubin come from that direction? You were like \"Why don't I go back to the source?\"\nPaul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and I was like, \"Fuck man.\" Another thing with this record is that I kind of got back into producing more. On Recovery, I wanted to focus more on writing, and not have to worry abut making the beats. On Relapse I think it was mostly all Dre. So I kind of started producing again a little bit. I was kind of in the middle of that when Paul had mentioned that, and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and I don't know if that's what made Paul reach out to Rick or if Rick reached out to him. But as soon as I heard he was interested I was like, \"Yo, just let me finish this up and let's go see him.\"\n\nYou've called Rick \"Yoda\" \u2013 was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career?\n[Yoda voice] Learning I did. Um, yeah, I mean the best part about Rick's vibe is he's very Zen-like in the sense of just \"Let it happen.\" The weird thing about it is nine times out 10, we would know instantly if something didn't work and it didn't feel right, you know. He's almost like a coach.\n\nHe's very psychological, right?\nYeah the guy's got his shoes off. [Laughs] Working with him is the most relaxed atmosphere. He's not afraid to try anything. I kind of felt in the same way I felt, and still feel to this day, as far as like wanting to impress Dre. We talked at his house and then I think we went straight to his studio from there and we started going through breakbeats. I told him that I had started experimenting with some more retro sounds. So we just sat down and started picking shit out and I would start writing to them and next time I'd get together with him we'd start adding shit to it. The dude's got so many ideas, man. One of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the Rick Rubin scratches. When he fucking scratches some shit, it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it. Not that it's off-time or anything like that, but it's just like \u2013 it's fucking weird. I don't even know how to explain it. You just know that he scratched it. I don't know if that even makes sense or not. It's like a simple scratch, like a basic kind of thing, but it's so fucking dope when you hear it. It's just, it's vintage him. And plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit.\n\nDid he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio?\nOh, he's got some shit in the stash. Yeah. Definitely.\n\nSo much has changed in hip-hop since you started producing \u2013 did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff?\nUm, not necessarily, because like I feel like I just do whatever feels right. Obviously I pay attention to what's going on and what's out and keep my finger on that pulse. But I don't ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing. That's no offense to anyone else.\n\nBasically, if there are outside influences that are current, you let that come in from the other producers, but your shit is your shit.\nYeah. That's exactly it. More current-sounding shit I leave to them. And not that I don't feel like my shit sounds current, but it's not the exact same thing. And I think I've updated as well.\n\nOn the new song \"Legacy\" you're talking about yourself in detail as a kid. What does it take to get back in that mindset at your age?\nI always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said, \"He ain't shit\" or bullied or whatever. It felt like one of them self-empowerment songs. Everybody, I believe, wants to show the world that, \"One day I'm gonna be this. One day I'm gonna be that.\" Everybody has goals, aspirations or whatever, and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them. Like, if you haven't been kicked or whatever, if you never went through. . .\n\nTribulations.\nTribulations and shit like that, then you're perfect and fuck you anyways. So everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted. Like, \"You don't matter.\" \"Oh yeah? I'm gonna show you.\" So it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy \u2013 into what I leave behind when I'm gone. And I always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me. There's many, many songs that got me through a lot of shit.\n\nI just love that you rhyme \"Onyx\" with \"comics\" on that song.\nI don't know if anyone will get this, like this is super-nerdy, but the rhyming words in that song never change. And that's just one of the things that I do to try to challenge myself. I wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed.\n\nYou've praised the Beastie Boys' evolution, but it doesn't seem like you're going to have a \"the disrespect for women has got to be through\" moment.\nI mean, listen, my sense of humor has certainly not gone away. I realize that I'm an adult, a grown-ass man, and I don't know what I'll be doing a year from now, 10 years from now, but I don't think that my tongue-in-cheekness will ever go away. I guess it's just a part of my personality. I always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well. If one song is darker or talking about a sad subject, I don't want to make a whole album of that, of being a downer. I don't want to make a whole album of being too uppity. You gotta try and find that right balance, and that's one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting. In other words, recording till I get it. And if I record 100 fucking songs and I don't have what I feel like I need yet to make the body of work, then I'm gonna keep going and keep recording.\n\nYou've written a bunch of your own hooks, and even sing some of them. Where does your sense of melody come from?\nThat's a good question. I would want to say that it's stemming from early hip-hop. Rappers used to fuck around all the time with melodies, at least on the shit that I grew up on. I don't know keys on a keyboard or what note this is or that is. I can only hum something. But I think it just comes from all the data that I've collected in my years of listening to music. And you know, fuck man, I think that as hip-hop started evolving, there was more melody in it, people were starting to sing hooks. Even like, early Slick Rick \u2013 [sings] \"Hey young world\" \u2013 those kind of things. Maybe I took it somewhere different at times, I don't know.\n\nMaybe it's just pure instinct.\nHonestly, that's probably what it is. I don't want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but I just don't know where I get that sense from, you know what I'm saying? I'm not a singer singer. I just know what's in key and what's not.\n\nHaving Kendrick Lamar on your album, did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you?\nI completely respect what Kendrick does and the fact that he's in the same camp, that he's on Aftermath, only made sense to me. He came to Detroit, we kicked it for a few minutes, you know, and I felt the vibe of what he's like and everything, and you know, he's a super cool and super humble dude. When we did that record, I think that was actually a week or two before he did the verse to \"Control.\"\n\nIs there advice you would give him at this point?\nI don't know if he needs advice. He seems like he's got a really good head on his shoulders, man. He's very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one. He's like a hip-hop head, man, he just loves hip-hop. And obviously the way that he did the \"Control\" verse, it was almost like if you get mad at him, then you might look foolish. He set it up so that you can't really get mad at a lot of that shit he said because it was what every other MC is already thinking. Or you should be thinking.\n\nFundamentally, do you feel like a rap god or do you feel like an underdog?\nI think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour, day by day with me. That whole \"Rap God\" record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek. So I mean, do I want to feel like that? Maybe sometimes. Again, it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best. Again, that's why Kendrick's verse worked so well because he only said what every rapper's already thinking, If you don't want to be the best, then why are you rapping?\n\n\n\nRead more: http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminem-q-a-exclusive-the-making-of-the-marshall-mathers-lp-2-20131101#ixzz38t7kbH5L\nFollow us: @rollingstone on Twitter | RollingStone on Facebook", "year": "2013-11-01"}, {"artist": "Eminem", "album": "Infinite", "title": "Run Your Jewels (Snippet)", "lyrics": "Little things start to trouble me, pressure me and bother me\nThis shit is mess to me, especially to poverty\nI always wondered what my destiny would offer me\nMy only guess would be accessory to robbery", "year": "1996-01-01"}, {"artist": "Eminem", "album": "Relapse", "title": "Same Song & Dance", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nYeah\nSame song and dance\nDamn girl, everywhere I go\nSame song and dance\nI like the way you move, all over the globe\nSame song and dance\nSomething about it, man\nSame song and dance\nIn the pale moonlight\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm looking at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by\nThe whole rapper thing, aren't ya?\nProbably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya\nWon't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?\nCouple rape charges, people think you're a monster\nThe police constantly bugging you, non-stop\nI walk up on ya, \"Well, hello Tonya\"\nI think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck\nYou out of gas?

What's going on? It's Paul. Uh, I wanted to call you to let you know we're getting ready to shoot the \"Monster\" video. We got dates for Rihanna and she's gonna come out to Detroit and we can get it shot. We've got some concepts together based on your conversations with Rich Lee and I think we're ready to go.\n\nSo the basic concept is sort of like an Inception-type of vibe. The whole video sort of happens inside of your head and Rihanna, in the beginning, is gonna act as your therapist. And you answer into her office, you sit down and you sort of fall asleep or drift off; we're not really sure. And next thing you know, you're travelling in this elevator and the elevator sort of represents your journey and your career. And there's various stops along the way. We're gonna recreate some scenes from some of your classic moments.\n\nI had to go home and get my straightjacket. Redoing this scene actually brings back no memories for me because I don't remember it. Dr Dre would say, \"I'm glad to see you got your coat back on. The way things should be.\"\n\nThe scene from the \"My Name Is\" video, with you in the straightjacket and Dre as your therapist in the psychiatrist's office there.The song which recieved an Oscar for you ,yes \"Lose yourself\" will also be included. We're gonna go back and revisit \"The Way I Am\", with you jumping off the building, falling through the sky, with everything moving past you. And then we're also gonna do the classic Grammy scene, with you and Elton John performing \"Stan\".\n\n\"I can't see it all. Even if I could, it'll all be grey. But your picture on my wall, it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad\".\n\nSo, all these things are going on in your head. You're travelling through the elevator, looking at it from a new perspective, with you watching yourself. And then when you finally get to the end of your journey in the elevator, you come out and you see this sort of caged beast. And the beast is actually Slim Shady.\n\nSlim Shady's inside of this cage and you walk up and you don't really know what's going on. And then you see it's actually yourself. And Slim Shady's feeding you some notes and we can just assume that the notes might be some lyrics or some song titles scribbled on them. And the idea that you keep feeding Slim Shady with fame and all of the things that go along with it. And the songs'll keep coming back out.\n\nSo, it's really kind of a trip. It's very surreal. Less performance than some of your recent videos but this is more cinematic and it's more of a story through this journey.\n\nSo, anyway. Call me back after you listen to this. Um, I sent the treatment over, read through it and get ready for some really long days. Later.\n\nI'm done. It's a wrap. Uh, I never want to perform in these clothes again. Way too small. I'm try'na go, like, quadruple X next time. So, these clothes are a fucking wrap too. Peace out.\n\nAnd goodnight. Give it up for him, folks.

over\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd it don\u2019t stop, oh-oooh\nAnd it don\u2019t quit, oh-oooh\nAnd it don\u2019t stop, oh-oooh\nAnd it don\u2019t quit, oh-oooh\nAnd I miss you, oh-oooh\nI just miss you, oh-oooh\nI just miss you, oh-oooh\nAnd homie, I\u2019ll never forget you, nooo\n\n[Verse 2]\nFor you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life\nSo sick it\u2019ll blow up the mic, it\u2019ll put the \"dyna\" in mite\nYeah, it\u2019ll make the dopest MC\nWanna jump off a bridge and shit himself\nTap dancin' all over the beat, it\u2019ll jump off the page and spit itself\nGuess that the best thing I can do\nRight now, Doody, for you is to rep\nSo I\u2019m gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah, I'ma do it to death\nAnd instead of mournin' your death\nI\u2019d rather celebrate your life, elevate to new heights\nStep on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics\n'Cause the way that I\u2019m feelin' tonight\nEverything I can just do right\nThere\u2019s nothin' that I can do wrong\nI\u2019m too strong and I\u2019m just too hype\nJust finish the rhyme and I bust it\nExcuse the corny metaphor, but they\u2019ll never ketchup\nTo all this energy that I\u2019ve mustard\nSo God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process\nTryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous\nBut this depression ain't takin' me hostage\nI\u2019ve been patiently watchin' this game\nPacin' these hallways, you had faith in me always\nProof, you knew I\u2019d come out of this slump\nRise from these ashes, come right back on their asses\nAnd go Mike Tyson on these bastards\nAnd I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes\nI\u2019ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em\nHomie, I know I\u2019m never gonna be the same without you\nI never woulda came in this game, I\u2019m goin' insane without you\nMatter fact, it was just the other night\nHad another dream about you\nYou told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew\nYou gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you\nYou told me, \"Naw, Doody, you\u2019re not!\"\nLayin' on that table, I knew\nI was gonna make it soon as you said, \"think of Hailie\", I knew\nThere wasn\u2019t no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies\nAnd Proof, not many are lucky enough\nTo have a guardian angel like you, Lord, I\u2019m so thankful\nPlease don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t feel grateful, I do\nJust grant me the strength that I need\nFor one more day to get through\nSo, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you\nI love you, Doody\n\n[Chorus]\nThe days are cold, livin' without you\nThe nights are long, I\u2019m growin' older\nI miss the days of old, thinkin' about you\nYou may be gone, but you\u2019re never over\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd it don\u2019t stop, oh-oooh\nAnd it don\u2019t quit, oh-oooh\nAnd it don\u2019t stop, oh-oooh\nAnd it don\u2019t quit, oh-oooh\nAnd I miss you, oh-oooh\nI just miss you, oh-oooh\nI just miss you, oh-oooh\nAnd homie, I\u2019ll never
