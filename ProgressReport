Progress Report
  I currently have full data in hand, but I am struggling to decide whether or
  not I should drop rows that have a missing year or to impute them.
  I have not done a full EDA, or really any EDA for that matter but plan on
  completing all my EDA and plots by the end of this week. Processing power is
  a slight issue, as it takes longer
  than I would like to run operations on my data frame
  (I will need to raise the volume on my AWS). My data frame has about 34000 rows
  and 4 columns (this is before tokenizing my lyrics). After completing EDA
  this week, next week I would like to focus in on modeling.
