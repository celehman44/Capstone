### Schedule of tasks

  - BE DONE BY 10/3/2018: Scrape 15-25k rap song's lyrics from the years 1995 - 2018
    from genius using a genius api wrapper.

    - I will get the billboard data by using the billboard api wrapper to
      get the hot-100 artists for every week in every year from 1995-2018

    - Next I will get lists of rapper's names by scraping from ranker.com.
      - I will then feed this list into the genius api wrapper, which then will
      give me the corresponding lyrics.

    - Create dataframe: find some way to get the billboard data conjoined with my
      lyrics corpus

  - BE DONE BY 10/8/2018: EDA: At this point I would like to be done with EDA,
    where I plan on doing extensive exploratory analysis, including
    about 12 - 15 plots showing different aspects of my data such as the most
    popular lyrics per year.

  - BE DONE BY 10/14/2018: Modeling: Be done with modeling and analyzing all of my data,
    where I plan on using models such as bagging classifiers, SVM's, and Random Forest.

  - BE DONE BY 10/17/2018: Summary statement, including my final conclusions as well as
    my takeaways or other findings.
